Suddenly we could gift our loved ones (and ourselves) with<a href="https://www.damselfly.com.au/collections/xl-quote-candles"> luxe candles</a> that smelled heavenly and also expressed exactly what we had on our minds. Like, &#8216;My love is like a candle &#8230; if you forget me I will burn your F*&amp;%ING house down&#8217; &#8211; a personal fave here at <strong>The Beauty Insider</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, the candles aren&#8217;t the only things that are super cool. Their creator, <strong>Christianna Heideman</strong>, is quite something too, which is why we asked her to hang with us for a bit and also, answer a few questions.</p>\n<p><strong>A brief career synopsis if you would â€¦</strong></p>\n<p>After starting a fine arts degree fresh out of high school, I soon realised that I actually wanted to focus on creating my own brand rather than studying. At 19, I launched Damselfly, which was quickly picked up by major fashion boutiques and before long was stocked across the world. After a small hiatus working in design for some larger scale Australian fashion companies, I re-launched the label in 2013, but also entered into the homewares market, and we now create unique quote candles, jewellery, homewares &amp; cosmetics.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2090 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215917/JPG-270x300.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215917/JPG-270x300.jpg 270w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215917/JPG.jpg 396w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" />\n<p><strong>Now &#8230; where does your inspiration come from?</strong></p>\n<p>Everywhere! Iâ€™m constantly absorbing inspiration from people, places, art, music, pop culture, fashion, travel, just to name a few&#8230; Anything can spark a design idea, or a new collection. I try to travel as much as my schedule allows, and itâ€™s often visiting new cultures that can move my design focus to a whole new colour palette or style.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the idea of quotes on candles come about?</strong></p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve always loved candles and have been intrigued by the art of apothecary and could see there was a gap in the market for a candle that speaks to people and connects with the customer on another level. My vision was to create a product that made you laugh, or inspired you to get up and kick ass, as well as being luxe and beautiful to look at. The market was saturated with beautiful, girly, floral candles and I wanted to create something that was classic and feminine but that also hit you right in the face.<br />\nThe first collection of quotes came straight from the heart and was basically a representation of my character in candle form. I had no idea how people would react to the random mermaid &amp; unicorn references, dry humour and dropping the F bomb in such a direct wayâ€¦ But it worked! I guess there are a lot of people out there like me with the same dry (slightly twisted..) sense of humour.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2088" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2088" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n.jpg 873w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Live the life you love.

Our customers have embraced the humour, and the point of difference we have created and really appreciate the idea of a traditional product being revamped. They love to select the perfect quotes as a gift, or a present to themselves and I think everyone finds a quote in the collections that feels like it was made just for them.</p>\n<p><strong>While we&#8217;ve got you &#8230; business tips for women wanting to strike out on their own?</strong></p>\n<p>Just â€˜Wake and Slayâ€™ ladies! Seriously, I think the most important skill is to back yourself and work your arse off, understand there will be a lot of long days and hard work, but you have got to â€˜risk it to get the biscuitâ€™. There is no point having a great idea in your head if you donâ€™t do anything about it.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about social media in general? Pros? Cons?</strong></p>\n<p>I love social media, mainly because it allows me to connect directly with our customers, and engage in real time communication. It can be so inspiring to interact with other brands, and we have created some incredible collaborations from our social media platforms. Cons? I think we can all be guilty of wasting too much time on social media, and as a business owner and entrepreneur, I donâ€™t have a lot of spare time! I try to cap the amount of time I spend in a â€˜scroll holeâ€™, and make sure that I switch off at the end of the day and focus on proper human interaction with my friends and family.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2087" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2087" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The world is out there &#8211; waiting.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>What are your plans for the future of Damselfly?</strong></p>\n<p>We have so many exciting projects in the pipeline, and it feels like we are working on a million new product lines at the moment.

Like fresh flowers and soft sheets, candles add a layer of luxury to your world. Personally Iâ€™m obsessed with candles, my office and home are filled with them! The first thing I do when I get home is light a candle and set the mood (and pour myself a glass of wine ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2091" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2091" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24220333/desk-job-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24220333/desk-job-300x198.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24220333/desk-job-768x507.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24220333/desk-job-1024x676.jpg 1024w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24220333/desk-job.jpg 1029w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Just chilling &#8211; #girlboss.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>How do you feel they can change the feel of a room, a home?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the ritual of lighting a candle sparks a sense of calm and indulgence. It creates warmth and softness to a room, and scents are such a vivid emotive trigger. We all know the reassuring feeling of a familiar fragrance, and it always makes a house feel more like a home. Plus, letâ€™s be honest, candlelight is always flattering.</p>\n<p><strong>Your three favourite Insta accounts for inspiration â€¦</strong></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2100 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24223542/J-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24223542/J-300x296.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24223542/J.jpg 586w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/captainandthegypsykid/?hl=en">@captainandthegypsykid.</a> Life goals in beautiful imagery and styling.

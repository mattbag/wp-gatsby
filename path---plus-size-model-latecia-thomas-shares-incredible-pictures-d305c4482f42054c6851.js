She&#8217;s proud of her curves and regularly shares images of herself to her more than 380K <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lateciat/">Instagram</a> followers.</p>\n<p>The girl is popular and it&#8217;s easy to see why. She&#8217;s beautiful in a full-lipped, high-cheeked, deeply appealing way. She&#8217;s also full thighed, boasts an impressive booty and has a killer cleavage to match.</p>\n<p>But she hasn&#8217;t always looked this way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3259" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3259" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231051/JPG-Before-After-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231051/JPG-Before-After-300x298.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231051/JPG-Before-After-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231051/JPG-Before-After.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@lateciat</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>La&#8217;Tecia was once a standard size 10. Recently she posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZSR00DF8Z7/?taken-by=lateciat">Before and After </a>images of herself, neatly spliced together and the difference is astonishing. What&#8217;s wonderful about this post is not the images, however, but the words La&#8217;Tecia wrote to accompany them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3262" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3262" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231730/JPG-Yellow-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231730/JPG-Yellow-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231730/JPG-Yellow-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28231730/JPG-Yellow.jpg 596w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@lateciat</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I remember how unhappy I was in the picture to the left, I would loathe certain parts of my body—particularly my bum/ thighs because that was and is the hardest part of my body to lose,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>“I had so many insecurities, I compared myself to other women and I lacked confidence.”</p>\n<p>Today La&#8217;Tecia loves her plus-size body and her life too.</p>\n<p>And before anyone suggests she&#8217;s not healthy, the woman exercises like a demon and daily too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3256" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3256" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28230233/JPG-Blue-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28230233/JPG-Blue-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28230233/JPG-Blue-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28230233/JPG-Blue.jpg 594w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@lateciat</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She posts shots of herself doing so and shares details about her training plan which is intense. She&#8217;s fit, she&#8217;s strong both physically and mentally, and she&#8217;s happier than ever before.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know about you, but we reckon there&#8217;s a message in here for all of us.</p>\n<p>Love yourself. Be You. Don&#8217;t waste a moment.</p>\n<p>Be healthy. Be happy. And never compare yourself to anyone else.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re you. The only you.

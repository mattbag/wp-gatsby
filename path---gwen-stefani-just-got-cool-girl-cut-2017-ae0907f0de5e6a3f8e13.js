Might be. Either way we love EVERY single thing about her, particularly her excellent new haircut.</p>\n<p>Yep, Gwen has joined the cool girl squad and had a fringe (or bangs as our friends in the US like to call them) cut in and she looks even more chic &#8211; we know &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t believe it either! But you can get confirmation right here &#8211; see exhibit A below. <strong>HELLO!</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_1807" style="width: 239px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1807" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22140336/Gwen-after-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22140336/Gwen-after-239x300.jpg 239w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22140336/Gwen-after.jpg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><strong><em>See!

One of the reasons for the popularity of this specific style is that a fringe will completely switch up your look and yet, doesn&#8217;t require a life-long commitment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A fringe is super cool, but it can be grown out relatively easily if you decide you don&#8217;t want to keep it anymore,&#8221; says award-winning stylist <a href="http://rawhair.com.au">Anthony Nader of RAW</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of things to think about before you take the plunge, however.</p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; thick, chunky style straight fringes are the epitome of cool right now <strong>(again &#8211; GWEN people, Gwen)</strong> but, unless your hair is naturally thick and also poker straight you&#8217;re looking at daily styling. Are you up for that?</p>\n<figure id="attachment_1808" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1808" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22141929/Gwen-before-and-after--300x297.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="297" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22141929/Gwen-before-and-after--300x297.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22141929/Gwen-before-and-after--150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22141929/Gwen-before-and-after-.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><strong><em>Gwen with no fringe. Gwen with fringe. We know which one we&#8217;re loving right now.

Will it turn you into a pop star? We&#8217;re not entirely certain but hey, it never hurts to look like one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/22135047/Gwen-before.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"hair",name:"Hair"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"bcd4ed14-c243-56a4-b7d9-b3476e6cfa64"}}}});

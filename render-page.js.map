They can transform you.</p>\\n<p><strong>Today you are …</strong></p>\\n<p>Obsessed with creating timeless tools and products for well-shaped brows to flatter the length and width of the face, whilst complementing the brows by contouring and also defining the cheeks and lips.

A brand that has strength, courage, femininity, and timeless and classic beauty. We knew there was a gap in the luxury brow market, and that there wasn’t an extensive brow range that was vegan – so took a chance to fill this gap in the market.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3450\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21230214/Selfie-Lightoff-seperate-265x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"265\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21230214/Selfie-Lightoff-seperate-265x300.jpg 265w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21230214/Selfie-Lightoff-seperate-768x868.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21230214/Selfie-Lightoff-seperate-906x1024.jpg 906w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.garboandkelly.com/collections/tools/products/selfie-halo-light\\\">Selfie Halo Light, $39.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>There are so many beauty products on the market already.

The secrets of success &#8211; Hamilton sister style.</p>\\n<p><strong>A little bit about yourselves both please …</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH</strong>: We’re twin sisters, mums, and the founders of bellabox and Sand &amp; Sky. I am based in Melbourne, and Emily is based out of Singapore.</p>\\n<p><strong>How did this particular product come to be?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> After years of studying what our members loved at bellabox, we tried to find a gap in the market and to produce a super results-orientated product that looks great on social media. Additionally, after many years living abroad we understood the attraction of Australia to our international friends – our accent embodies a relaxed beach culture, with glowing skin of course!</p>\\n<p>So we wanted to bring Australia to the world and we wanted to show off the power of the ingredients produced here. We were also super keen to support Australian industry.</p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> We have both lived overseas for many years and what we realised is that everywhere we went we were recognised as being Australian, and this came with the assumption that we were friendly, laid back, beachy and living the dream. Australia has become really cool internationally and we wanted to be able to bring a piece of Australia to the rest of the world.</p>\\n<p>We knew people could use something that was proven to be amazing for them that was made with Aussie ingredients. We are very keen to support the Australian beauty industry and help return manufacturing here, too.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3321\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-300x200.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506.jpg 1280w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p>Emily and Sarah Hamilton &#8211; sisters, co-workers and damn clever woman.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s so great about it?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Results, results, results. Everyone is time poor so we can’t wait two weeks to see the benefits of a product. We had to make sure that you would feel a difference each and every time you used our Sand &amp; Sky Mask. No ingredients are wasted, everything is at active levels and as Australian ingredients come from a pure environment, a little bit has immediate impact.</p>\\n<p><strong>Do you think social media has had a part to play in its popularity?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Definitely, and more so because people are sharing their results in real time – everyone wants to be the first to know about a product so that they can share it with the rest of the world, quickly! Plus we really love the Australian bright vibe of the brand and packaging which looks great on social media.</p>\\n<p><strong>On that, how do you feel about social media as opposed to more traditional forms of advertising and publicity?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Every medium has its benefits. We love real time feedback from customers on social media and the ability for a product to go viral very very quickly. However, there is still a big trust element to more traditional advertising and we want to reach everyone, so we don’t want to limit how we can show off Sand &amp; Sky!</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2608\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG.jpg 450w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Our top video has gone viral with over 3.5 million views, so this illustrates the added value of social media!</p>\\n<p><strong>Sisters &#8211; working together &#8230; Pros?

Plus we have worked together before and have enormous respect for each other and we share being determined and hard working, so we can’t argue about that!</p>\\n<p><strong>The beauty business is firing &#8211; what would you say to other folk who would like to get in on that action?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Social media gives everyone the ability to launch a product quickly and to harness the amazing viral impact you can reach. But to create a social media star, you need to focus on creating a product that really brings the user real and immediate results. It can&#8217;t just be good, it has to be amazing!</p>\\n<p><strong>How do we keep our skin glowing and fresh (aside from this mask obviously!)</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> We try really hard to properly remove makeup each night! Lots of hydration, vitamin C and vitamin A.</p>\\n<p><strong>What do you think is the best corporate I&#8217;m here to do business don&#8217;t mess with me but heck I still look damn good style of makeup?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Whatever makes you comfortable! Worry about yourself first and own your look – if others don’t like it then that is there problem. Also check your attitude and presence, become authentic and create an impact when you meet with others.</p>\\n<p><strong>Same same for hair?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Ditto. It shows your personality when you dress the way you want.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3329\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01223118/JPG-skin-mask-sand-300x215.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"215\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01223118/JPG-skin-mask-sand-300x215.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01223118/JPG-skin-mask-sand.jpg 711w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>And again for outfits &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> I would say, go bright. No navy suits! Stand out with colour blocking! Also, bring your energy as it will show.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you think women fit into the landscape of business?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> We were brought up without consideration of what our sex meant for our future in business, so this is always a hard one to answer. We can see the challenges for women and we are lucky to have a really empowered team that should not see being a woman as an issue. So how do women fit in? Just the same as men, with a few more hurdles that need to be faced.</p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> When we left university and started our careers, we felt empowered to achieve anything we wanted! Both of us really followed our ambitions around the world, where any opportunity presented itself. I think most entrepreneurs do the same.</p>\\n<p>But now targeting women on e-commerce makes sense, as more women shop and they spend more. Not only that, we are the fastest growing social ecommerce company, and we connect with our female customers each day on social media. As we intimately know and use the products we create, we can use our women power for the better!</p>\\n<p><strong>Are we better? Worse? And if so in what ways?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> We are the best that we can be, no point worrying about what others are doing!</p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Half the world is made up of women. If you find you are not achieving your dreams in business, there are plenty of other areas to achieve it. Chase the opportunity.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2611\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy-300x169.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"169\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy.jpg 640w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Your future looks like?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Fun and relaxed hopefully. We are starting to focus more on retail for Sand &amp; Sky after launching in Harvey Nichols in the UK.</p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> We are working on expanding the Sand &amp; Sky Australian Pink Clay range with two new products planned for 2017. We are researching new concepts to grow the reach and the product range for 2018. It’s time to put Australian botanicals on the map!</p>\\n<p><strong>Do you have a five-year plan?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> We have a 24-month plan; more products and another Australian botanical range. We are investing in super growth for 2018!</p>\\n<p><strong>Believe in goal-setting and if so, your specific formula? Vision board? Diary?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> I really believe in self-improvement and so I set myself goals to learn something new, from a sport, to management and areas of the business. I have my own formula for this, to allocate a month and as much time as I can, which includes reading books, being coached and attending information seminars or events. I try to do this twice a year. I am planning to dive really deep into brand story telling in the coming weeks. Upping my tennis game is always on my list too!</p>\\n<p><strong>Women who want to be successful must always &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Discover your true self, set goals and focus.</p>\\n<p><strong>And never &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Never give up, and try not to blame others!</p>\\n<p><strong>And you will both ALWAYS tell other young women in life that &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> I believe in the mantra, you are the creator of your own life.

Here&#8217;s the thing. She&#8217;s a doctor. Like, a legitimate doctor. The real deal. So, obviously she knows what&#8217;s what as far as skincare is concerned. Ginni Mansberg, or should we say Dr Mansberg, has the most beautiful skin we&#8217;ve ever clapped eyes on.</p>\\n<p>Not surprisingly when you consider that&#8217;s what she specialises in. We&#8217;re not doctors. And we don&#8217;t know exactly how to get that glow. So we did the smart thing &#8211; and asked Dr Mansberg to tell us. And this is what she said.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: I&#8217;m 47 and I feel like I went to bed last night and woke up old! What the hell happened?</strong></p>\\n<p>It can feel that way when a lifetime of sun worshiping, smiling, bad habits like smoking and drinking catch up with you and reveal themselves for all to see on your face. Many of us who just use cheap moisturiser from the supermarket suddenly need to take our skin care seriously.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: How can I fight the inevitable in terms of skincare habits?</strong><br />\\nThere’s nothing like spotting your first wrinkle, fine line, large pore or age spot to motivate you to take your skin care seriously. Especially in this era of Instagram and facebook when all your &#8216;character&#8217; is there for the world to see.</p>\\n<p><strong>So, step one:</strong> decide you would like your face to look younger rather than having to trowel on an extra layer of foundation. That means making a commitment to using high quality cosmeceutical skin care with active skin care ingredients every day.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_3296\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-3296\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194348/JPG-Dr-Ginni-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194348/JPG-Dr-Ginni-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194348/JPG-Dr-Ginni-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194348/JPG-Dr-Ginni.jpg 721w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The good doctor herself. Good skin eh? Yes. Yes indeed.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><strong>Q: Should I be using specific anti-ageing ingredients and if so, which and why?</strong><br />\\nYou betcha!</p>\\n<p><strong>One</strong>: I wouldn’t consider leaving Vitamin C off my skincare regime. It repairs and protects from sun damage. Problem is finding one that gets the evidence tick. Look for 10% concentration L-Ascorbic acid (only!), water in oil emulsion, airless and light protected bottle.</p>\\n<p><strong>Two</strong>: A leave on hydroxy (Glycolic and Lactic) acid serum, about 5% concentration, is amazing for smoothing the skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Three</strong>: An effective form of Vitamin A will reduce wrinkles and increase suppleness (it’s also good for managing breakouts). That means either Tretinion on prescription from your doctor or Retinal/Retinaldehyde (NOT Retinol).</p>\\n<p><strong>Four</strong>: Niacinamide. It reduces ages spots and wrinkles and improves skin barrier function.</p>\\n<p><strong>Five</strong>: A high quality Zinc (not chemical) based sunscreen with high UVA filters (Remember UV: A for aging and B for burning). This is for use every day including winter.</p>\\n<p><strong>Six:</strong> A good quality soap free cleanser that won’t inflame or dry out your skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: My younger girlfriends (20s, 30s) are wondering whether it&#8217;s too early to star fighting the clock? What do you suggest they do?</strong><br />\\nWe all know that prevention is better than cure and it’s far better to start using cosmeceutical skin care sooner rather than later. The results might not be as dramatic, or happen as quickly, but they will appreciate the effort when they hit their forties.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: My older girlfriends (50s, 60s) are concerned they may have left it too late. To that you say &#8230; and you recommend &#8230;</strong><br />\\nIt&#8217;s never too late. In fact, some of the most dramatic results I have seen have been with older skin. All the same rules apply, but remember skin can get more sensitive after menopause. So, when using a cosmeceutical skincare regime for the first time start slowly and build up gradually.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3297\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194757/JPG-ESK-300x225.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"225\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194757/JPG-ESK-300x225.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01194757/JPG-ESK.jpg 512w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.eskcare.com/product/daily-regime-full-size-save-30/\\\">ESK &#8211; Evidence Based Skincare by Dr Ginni Mansberg. The Daily Regime Full Size Pack, $369.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Q: What does your daily skincare routine look like?</strong><br />\\nI use ESK skincare daily regime. I start with the Hydroxy cleanser, then use Reverse C Serum – the absolute best Vitamin C serum anywhere. I am managing ages spots, so I follow that with Enlighten cream and finally the Zinc Shade day cream. At night, I remove my make up with Calming Cleanse, then wash with Hydroxy Cleanser. I follow that with Smooth Serum and finally Ultimate A+. If that sounds ridiculously complicated, I can tell you that I spend a grand total of four minutes max on my face every day.<br />\\nAnd that four minutes is so worth it. I look back at photos of myself taken five years ago, before I started ESK and can’t believe how much younger my skin looks now.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: How did you get involved in this business?</strong><br />\\nIt actually all started with a series of TV segments in which we would discuss what really works for anti-aging skincare. I would get so many emails from viewers asking me which products they should buy. I started looking in to it and to my utter dismay, despite, the huge range of skincare products available in Australia, there was nothing I could recommend that matched the studies. At the same time, I hit my forties and all of a sudden I realised I couldn’t rely on standard beauty products for my skin. What started as a bit of frustration lead to me creating my own skincare that I could hand on heart recommend as scientifically valid and that was also, beautiful, simple to use and ethically made.<br />\\nEvidence, Efficacy and Integrity were the three principles that I started with. They have remained front and centre of everything we do to this day.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3299\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01195250/JPG-Travel-Kit-300x219.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"219\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01195250/JPG-Travel-Kit-300x219.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01195250/JPG-Travel-Kit.jpg 418w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.eskcare.com/product/daily-regime-travel-set/\\\">Want to start smaller?

I also need to be able hold my head up high &#8211; which means, at all times, acting ethically and providing a solution that people get real value from. I would also recommend you learn resilience – you will need it. Not everybody you meet will think your idea is as incredible as you do.</p>\\n<p>Make sure that you can afford to put your heart and soul into it, which might mean giving up your day job. I was lucky enough that my husband Daniel was able to do this. Don’t grow too quickly. I have met so many power women overflowing with incredible ideas.

Because well, who wouldn&#8217;t?</p>\\n<p>The fabulous new nail lacquer was applied in 20 minutes or so.

Yes. <strong>FIVE years.</strong></p>\\n<p>Of course, as anyone who has ever used gel nails will know, my fingernails always looked amazing. I had that just walked out of the salon look only ALL the time! At least, I did until the day I decided to quit using them and discovered that the health of my natural nails was now somewhat dubious.</p>\\n<p>The colour on my nails were now distinctly yellow and looked as though I&#8217;d smoked a carton of cigarettes every day since birth. The nails themselves were thin and fragile too.

Firstly, she confirmed my worst fears. Gel nails worn long-term are not the best. Sigh.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Wearing gels for such an intensive period without a break is harmful to your nails in several ways,&#8221; said Tracey.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Some nail polishes, in particular gel ones, are non porous. They occlude the nail, suffocating it from airflow and resulting in a weaker, softer nail. This weakening of the nail surface has a knock-on effect on the nail bed and root, which sees critical blood and nutrients flow reduced. This impacts nail growth and can result in a poorly formed nail plate.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Super bummer.</p>\\n<p>And it gets worse. Apparently, removing gel nails with acetone creates a further myriad of issues from dryness through to peeling and brittleness.</p>\\n<p>That is why it is important to detox between cycles of gel nails and allow the nail time to recover, said Tracey.</p>\\n<p>Whilst in recovery mode, it’s all about treatment and feeding the nails with topically applied products and a diet rich in vitamins and minerals.</p>\\n<p>Apparently, a key mineral for nails is silicium, which is literally like ‘cell cement’ and helps nails to grow faster and more resistant.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3223\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23200952/9090561F-215x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"215\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23200952/9090561F-215x300.jpg 215w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23200952/9090561F-768x1069.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23200952/9090561F-735x1024.jpg 735w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.mavala.com.au/new-products/nailactan-1\\\">Mavala Nailactan Nail Cream, $31.95.</a></p>\\n<p>&#8220;I always advise clients to use an intensive nail treatment cream or serum, rich in high performing ingredients that will combat dryness and nourish the nail,&#8221; added Tracey, who likes <strong>Mavala&#8217;s Nailactan Nail Cream.</strong></p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crammed with essential amino acids, lipids and vitamins. It nourishes the nail, counteracts dryness and helps to restore elasticity to the nail plate, thus strengthening nails.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Her final piece of advice to me and my sad nails. Show them some love.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Your nails will need a lot of TLC in the detox and recovery period to restore natural nail health,&#8221; said Tracey.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The average cycle of nail growth is three to five months, so I would advise infrequent application of gels to maintain optimum nail health year round.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>And when they recover I can tell you exactly what I&#8217;ll do &#8230; get gel nails again. Because let&#8217;s face it &#8211; they are ACE! Only this time, I will give my nails a break from time to time.

The founder of the <a href=\\\"https://www.thetonik.com.au/tonik\\\"><strong>beauty and health vitamin co Tonik</strong></a> launched a business on her lonesome and made it work too. Sure, she worked around the clock to make that happen and she may have neglected her friends and family for a little while there, but now the passionate business woman is sitting pretty.</p>\\n<p>Something we will be doing too if we pop a few of her clever, beauty-boosting pills. Like to learn more? We thought so. Ladies and gentleman &#8211; life (and also beauty, fashion and of course career) advice from the very clever clogs Pip.</p>\\n<p><strong>1. A little bit about you and your professional background please.</strong><br />\\nI am from New Zealand. I grew up in a little coastal town in Northland New Zealand. I grew up on the ocean and I spent many hours  running amok in my dad’s pharmacy. I think my interest in health and wellness was sparked as a little girl especially natural health. I am a graphic designer &amp; marketing guru by study but I love the water and one of my hobbies is underwater photography.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. And now Tonik. How did the product come to be?</strong><br />\\nIt came about after years of travelling and having to cart around bottles of apple cider vinegar in my bags. I also hated the taste of apple cider! I was on a work trip in Indonesia and the idea just dawned on me and was one of those magical moments where I thought, hang on a minute what about apple cider in capsule form? The rest is history but I am really lucky to have a father who is a pharmacist so we both worked on formulas and coming up with the Toniks.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. What do you hope to achieve with the brand &#8211; both for yourself and those who buy it?</strong><br />\\nIf I can change just one person&#8217;s health and over all wellbeing then I will be kicking goals. I have taken apple cider for the better part of 10 years and it has done wonders for my skin, hair nails and digestive systems. There is so much out there claiming X Y &amp; Z for health and wellness but the beauty about Tonik is it really is all natural and organic. My overall goal is to create a wellness hub where people can have access to unlimited information and support from like-minded individuals in the health and wellness area.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3206\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>4. Can you pass on any general business advice or is it just too tricky?</strong><br />\\nI believe in following your gut instinct. I am no wonder woman but the idea was just so strong in my mind I had to do something about it. The process took just over two years to be able to launch Tonik so the only advice I would have is run the marathon not the sprint. It&#8217;s best do it right from the get go.</p>\\n<p><strong>5. Finish the sentence &#8230; a woman in business can achieve … </strong><br />\\nAbsolutely anything she believes she can. Dreams come true to those who chase them fearlessly.</p>\\n<p><strong>6. We were crazy for fitness, then leisure-wear, now cocooning and body positivity. Do you foresee any other trends?</strong><br />\\nNatural health is the next big thing, it all comes down to looking after yourself and feeling great in the skin you are in. I strongly believe natural health is the key to living a long and happy life!</p>\\n<p><strong>7. Give me three top beauty tips please &#8230;</strong><br />\\nDrinking lots of water, exercise daily &amp; taking time for yourself whenever you can</p>\\n<p><strong>8. What does you beauty routine look like &#8230;</strong><br />\\nGosh that’s embarrassing, I don’t have any routine. If I can leave the house looking half decent I&#8217;m having a good day.</p>\\n<p><strong>9. Three fashion + style tips please &#8230;</strong><br />\\nComfort first, a belted dress with boots and a big handbag.</p>\\n<p><strong>10. How about health + fitness tips? As personal (or not) as you please. </strong><br />\\nI think it&#8217;s so important to keep moving. It&#8217;s good for the head and the body. I start my day off with bootcamp and if I don’t go I regret it as it helps me wake up and get ready for everything that&#8217;s ahead.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3205\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>11. It is currently 1.21am and I should be asleep but I am working, working, working which is not good. It&#8217;s so hard to get it all done. How do you fit everything in?</strong><br />\\nI hear ya! I have had to learn a lot about balancing work / life. The best thing I ever did was disconnect my phone when I leave the office. I think switching off gives you the time to be super focused when you need to be switched on.</p>\\n<p><strong>12. Women are killer business owners because … </strong><br />\\nWe can multi-task ( haha am I allowed to say that? )</p>\\n<p><strong>13. Do you have any advice for women wanting to launch a new business or grow the one they already have? </strong><br />\\nI think you really have to value and believe in whatever it is your doing. If you don’t believe in it or swear by it why would anyone else want a bar of it? Stay focused, write goals and go into a new day with positive thoughts. Negativity will get you nowhere. I learnt that the hard way!</p>\\n<p><strong>14. Practical tips of any kind? Instagram, a good PR agent, a solid support team? </strong><br />\\nI think as you grow, the support team is the biggest help. I am so lucky I have such an amazing support team.</p>\\n<p><strong>15. Any downsides to being a woman in business? </strong><br />\\nOh definitely &#8230; it consumed me until recently. I have been extremely focused and it isolated me from family and friends. It&#8217;s all about balance. Once you nail the balance you&#8217;re sorted on all fronts!</p>\\n<p><strong>16. Future you &#8211; do you have a five year plan or a dream for the future? </strong><br />\\nAbsolutely! Right now it&#8217;s all about growing the brand into something I can look at and be really proud of. I want to create much more than just a product business &#8211; I want to create a community.</p>\\n<p><strong>17. Something you&#8217;ve achieved that you&#8217;re super proud of … </strong><br />\\nLaunching Tonik and learning along the way!</p>\\n<p><strong>18.

And you might be surprised by her answer. Turns out Nicole broke a cardinal beauty rule &#8211; only she made it work. That rule? Matching your lipstick to your outfit which apparently is just not done.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_3164\\\" style=\\\"width: 262px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-3164\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20205924/Hollywoodciak-JPG-262x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"262\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20205924/Hollywoodciak-JPG-262x300.jpg 262w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20205924/Hollywoodciak-JPG.jpg 516w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Lady in red.

And it ROCKED, says Jade.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Normally I would advise against trying to match a red lip to your red dress as it can easily look OTT but Nicole Kidman absolutely nails it,&#8221; she says.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Why? Because the look plays up her utterly flawless and iridescent skin. That and she’s opted for a very soft face-framing up do that brings the intensity of colour choice down a notch.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Fancy giving it a try yourself? Here&#8217;s how, according to Jade.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Nicole&#8217;s Emmy look can be reproduced,&#8221; she says.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need a quality primer and then, matte-based powders that reduce shine.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Jade recommends <strong>Youngblood Pressed Mineral Foundation, $79.95</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Thick curtain veil lashes finish the look here.

Less!</strong> Layers of heavy foundation make lines look worse.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;If you have always worn a lot of base, you probably need to use less and with a lighter touch,&#8221; says Josephine Fairley, co-author of <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Ageing-Beauty-Bible/dp/0857833170\\\">The Anti-Ageing Bible.</a></p>\\n<p>&#8220;You want uniformity &#8211; but you don&#8217;t want a mask-like effect,&#8221; she adds.</p>\\n<p>To get <strong>anti-ageing foundation</strong> just right now that you&#8217;re in your 40s try the following steps.</p>\\n<p><strong>Use a primer</strong>. Once applied let it absorb for at least five minutes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Next up foundation</strong>. Steer clear of matt finishes and also foundations that are heavy. If you have oily skin opt for an oil-free version. Dry skins will benefit from foundations that hydrate.</p>\\n<p><strong>Choose the right colour</strong>. To get the shade absolutely right test it on your neck, just below the jaw. Now look at it in daylight. If you can&#8217;t see it properly ask a trusted friend to look too. The right shade will seemingly disappear when on the skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Apply right.</strong> Apply with a foundation brush using light strokes working outwards from the middle of the face. You don&#8217;t want to overdo it. If brushes aren&#8217;t your thing smooth with your fingers. Once the foundation is applied, press gently with the palms of your hands. This will give a lovely natural effect.</p>\\n<p><strong>Conceal if needed.</strong> Once you&#8217;re finished stand back and take a long look in the mirror. If you see any teeny, tiny flaws or redness apply a touch of concealer and voila &#8211; you&#8217;re perfect.</p>\\n<p>Some of our favourites &#8230;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3144\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205626/Estee-Lauder-JPG-189x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"189\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205626/Estee-Lauder-JPG-189x300.jpg 189w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205626/Estee-Lauder-JPG.jpg 445w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Estee Lauder Double Wear Light Stay-in-Place Makeup SPF 10, $54.</strong></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3145\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205723/Dior-Skin-JPG-109x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"109\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205723/Dior-Skin-JPG-109x300.jpg 109w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205723/Dior-Skin-JPG.jpg 210w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Dior Diorskin Nude Fluid Foundation, $89.</strong></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3146\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205757/Armani-JPG-146x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205757/Armani-JPG-146x300.jpg 146w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205757/Armani-JPG.jpg 358w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Giorgio Armani Designer Lift Smoothing Firming Foundation, $109.</strong></p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09202130/Cindy-C-JPG.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"776bb317-1018-5c6f-9480-834815e936db\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/choose-anti-ageing-foundation.json\n// module id = 580\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Kate Ritchie Is All Grown Up And She&#8217;s Not Afraid To Show It\",\"content\":\"<p>We fell in love with Kate Ritchie when the actress played Sally Fletcher in the fictional town of Summer Bay in the TV series Home &amp; Away.

This includes having any products I use on a daily basis right there in front of me.</p>\\n<p>Whether that be in the shower or front and centre on the vanity alongside my toothbrush serving as a constant reminder. I cleanse and moisturise morning and night and at this time of year I’m using the <a href=\\\"https://www.qvskincare.com.au/product/qv-face-nurturing-night-cream\\\">QV Face Nurturing Night Cream</a> because my skin really needs it.

Any time for hair? Lord knows I don’t. Did I say that out loud? Yes. Yes I did.</strong></p>\\n<p>I’m blonder than usual at the moment so I really have to start lifting my haircare game. I must admit, I have been spoilt when it comes to hair over the years and it dates back to my days on set with Home and Away.</p>\\n<p>I used to loathe having someone tell me what I could or couldn’t do with my hair or when I could have it cut and to what length. Now, I love that kind of direction! I met the super stylish and super talented Lilly Miljkovic in the makeup room during that period of my life and to this day she continues to cut, colour and style my hair. Right now we are Oribe obsessed..</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: How did you get involved with this venture? Were you already familiar with the Jockey brand?</strong></p>\\n<p>Of course. Jockey is a brand with a long history of greatness and I have had many pairs of their most comfortable knickers floating around my underwear drawer over the years. So when they approached me to be the ambassador for The Weekender range I was at first flattered and secondly eager to take on a role I hadn’t previously.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to try something new, push my boundaries and fingers crossed &#8211; end up with a fresh, new Jockey underwear and loungewear cupboard!</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: Do you think Australian women are particularly beautiful and if so why? </strong></p>\\n<p>Not necessarily. I find there are beautiful women the world over, Australia included. To me what makes them all beautiful is a shared sense of confidence in their own skin and an air of mystery.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: Secret to your gorgeous glowing complexion is …</strong></p>\\n<p>More sleep than alcohol. A healthy, restful mind. Plenty of hydration. And if all else fails &#8211; a bullet proof concealer.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3126\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-300x200.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-1024x683.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Q: General beauty tip for women of all ages?</strong></p>\\n<p>I have two. ‘Be happy’ closely followed by ‘Don’t pick your spots’.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: When you look in the mirror you see …</strong></p>\\n<p>A woman who should trust her judgement a little more.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: You plan to teach your little one what about women and beauty and body image?</strong></p>\\n<p>That we can do anything. That we don’t need to make other women, or anyone for that matter, feel small in order to feel big/better/happier and that the most important thing we should strive to be is the best version of ourselves. No one else.</p>\\n<p><strong>Q: Underwear should be …</strong></p>\\n<p>The correct size first and foremost and then I find I want my underwear to be the perfect mix of comfort and style and a little bit of luxe. My go-to underwear style is the Jockey Parisienne range. The cuts are so comfortable and flattering.

Firstly, quality sleep means increased blood flow and that means less under-eye circles and puffiness. Yes!

For those who haven’t done much research in the natural sleep aid space lately, there are some weird but wonderful options out there – we’re talking what dreams are (literally) made of.<br />\\nMagnesium is known for its ability to improve sleep, improve muscle recovery and help with cramping. If I’ve been really active generally or have pushed myself during a workout I use <a href=\\\"https://www.saltlaboratory.com/products/salt-lab-200ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhJWxyNyF1gIVzAMqCh2X8g3lEAAYASAAEgIlb_D_BwE\\\">Salt Lab’s Magnesium Oil </a>– it’s an easy spray that can be quickly applied before bed.

There are a few gentle poses that you can do in bed, which will help relieve tension, promote blood flow and switch off your mind – aiding in a restful night. These are also great if you are on your feet a lot during the day and experience stiffness in your legs.<br />\\nI like to start with Viparita Karani, otherwise known as the ‘legs up the wall’, except with my headboard. I also spend two minutes each on the cat stretch and child’s pose, which are amazing for getting the blood circulation going ahead of bed. The ‘night time goddess stretch’, so aptly named, is also brilliant for this – for this one, lay on your back facing the ceiling with the soles of your feet pressed together and your knees bent (like a diamond shape) and breathe. Remember to take long, steady breaths as you relax into these poses.</p>\\n<p>Mary has teamed up with the beauty site <a href=\\\"https://www.ry.com.au\\\">RY.com.au</a> to produce a Natural Edit.

So when we heard that there&#8217;s a magical ingredient that can not only resolve those issues, but actually prevent some of them from occurring in the first place we got pretty excited.</p>\\n<p>We immediately hunted down someone who would know all about it. And that someone was <a href=\\\"http://www.assurecosmeticcentre.com.au\\\">dermal therapist Anna Robinson</a>. And she revealed the secret &#8211; drum roll please &#8211; vitamin C. We also discovered from another beauty insider, who wanted to remain nameless, that it&#8217;s this very ingredient that models use to get their impossibly luminescent glow.</p>\\n<p>Want to know more? We certainly did and so we gave Anna a bit of a grilling. And this is how it went.</p>\\n<p><strong>Vitamin C seems to be super popular right now yes?</strong></p>\\n<p>Vitamin C has consistently been our best-selling product for at least eight years now. It works so well in conjunction with our in-clinic treatments, as it helps clients with their pre- and post-treatment skincare, and helps maintain their results after treatment.</p>\\n<p>With our Australian climate being so harsh, I believe absolutely everyone should be using it to help protect their skin against harmful free radical damage.</p>\\n<p>It is an essential step in any skincare routine, both male and female.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3021\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02025242/J-Obagi-C.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"292\\\" height=\\\"331\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02025242/J-Obagi-C.jpg 292w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02025242/J-Obagi-C-265x300.jpg 265w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px\\\" />\\n<p>Anna likes the Obagi range in particular the vitamin C products. <a href=\\\"http://www.obagi.com.au/products.html\\\">Obagi Professional-C Serum 15%, $120.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Are there rules for when we’re using skincare ingredients with vitamin C?</strong></p>\\n<p>Vitamin C is a morning-only serum, as it protects your skin against free radical damage during daylight hours. It should always be used first thing after cleansing and toning, followed by a moisturiser and a physical SPF 30+.</p>\\n<p>It is also important to research your vitamin C serum before buying. For it to be effective, it needs to be in a pure, stable form, made from L-Ascorbic Acid. There are a lot of products out there claiming to contain vitamin C, however many do not have the right concentration, meaning they are not as effective or beneficial to the user.</p>\\n<p><strong>If we use it and we use it as per directions, how long will it take for us to see results? Actually &#8230; what are the results?</strong></p>\\n<p>Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant for the skin. It helps protect from harmful environmental stressors by neutralising free radicals on the skin before they cause damage. It also assists in cellular repair of the skin.</p>\\n<p>Without vitamin C, when we go outside and the sun hits our face and chest, a chemical reaction occurs where our melanocytes turn into melanin, leaving us with unsightly pigmentation which builds up over the years. The correct use of Vitamin C serum is clinically proven to inhibit melanin production.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3022\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030040/J-Skin-C-141x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"141\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030040/J-Skin-C-141x300.jpg 141w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030040/J-Skin-C.jpg 254w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\\\" />\\n<p>There are plenty of vitamin c products available. Try <a href=\\\"http://www.skinceuticals.com.au/Antioxidants/C-E-Ferulic/p2755.aspx\\\">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic, $214.</a></p>\\n<p>A lot of people do not realise that sunscreen only stops you from burning, it won’t necessarily stop you from still tanned or developing freckles. That is where vitamin C comes in, as it blocks melanin production, while your sunscreen protects from burning. So, using vitamin C and SPF together every morning is the best possible thing you can do to prevent and protect your skin from damage.</p>\\n<p>Over time, vitamin C will help fade your pigmentation, but most importantly, it helps prevent it from developing in the first place. Prevention is always best!</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3024\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030608/J-Ordinary-287x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"287\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030608/J-Ordinary-287x300.jpg 287w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030608/J-Ordinary.jpg 662w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\\\" />\\n<p>There&#8217;s also <a href=\\\"https://www.priceline.com.au/the-ordinary-vitamin-c-suspension-23-ha-spheres-2-30-ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1qbaxLuE1gIVmgYqCh0o4g9HEAYYAiABEgKVaPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\\\">The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Sphere 2%, $9.80.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Anything else this powerhouse vitamin can do?</strong></p>\\n<p>The use of antioxidants on the skin can also help prevent DNA damage from electronic devices such as mobile phones and computers.</p>\\n<p><strong>So there you have it.

The stuff is straight-up genius. Firstly, it means you can skip a wash and hair will still look bouncy and fresh.</p>\\n<p>Even better, it provides excellent texture making styling more simple and for those who have limp, fine hair, it&#8217;s a godsend because it provides serious volume.</p>\\n<p>But, <strong>(there&#8217;s always a but right?)</strong>, those effects are only gained when you use the stuff correctly. So here&#8217;s a quick how-to guide for you all.</p>\\n<p>Segment hair into six to eight sections, depending on how much you&#8217;ve got. Hold a section in your hand and lift it at the roots. Spray a little <strong>(A LITTLE)</strong> dry shampoo at the roots and lightly massage in.</p>\\n<p>Move to the next section and repeat. And that&#8217;s it! Do not spray all over your head like hair spray &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t work like that.</p>\\n<p>The idea behind dry shampoo is that it absorbs oil and dirt to make hair appear clean. And where does oil and dirt tend to be? At the roots.</p>\\n<p>Gradually introduce dry shampoo into your routine and you can begin to cut back on washing.

What causes them?</strong></p>\\n<p>Acne Vulgaris is the medical term for acne as we all know it.  There are other kinds of acne as well that are much rarer but generally, when people talk about acne they are talking about acne vulgaris.  In general though, there are three “stages” or “types” of pimples:</p>\\n<p><strong>Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads)</strong> &#8211; the difference between them is that blackheads are OPEN comedones, meaning that a pore is clogged up with keratin (dead skin cells) that is open to the surface of the skin.  When the skin cells are exposed to oxygen, they darken and these are the blackheads we all know about.  Whiteheads are CLOSED comedones which means that there’s a cover over it which means that the skin cells are not exposed to the oxygen so they will appear white &#8211; they’re usually pretty hard to see unless you stretch the skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pustules and Inflammatory Papules</strong> (that traditional white raised bump or the red angry bumps on the skin) &#8211; The next level of severity is to have a papule or a pustule.  There is a bacteria on our skin called Proprionibacterium Acnes (“P.Acnes” for short) &#8211; this is the bacteria that, when it gets trapped under the skin with a blackhead or a whitehead, that’s when these papules and pustules form, creating an inflammatory reaction, redness and increased pain in the area.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2945\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2945\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20144301/Dr-PP-Skin-JPG-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20144301/Dr-PP-Skin-JPG-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20144301/Dr-PP-Skin-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20144301/Dr-PP-Skin-JPG.jpg 398w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Sure, her skin is perfect &#8230; and there&#8217;s a reason for that.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Cysts and Nodules</strong> (deep seated bumps really under the skin, can be very painful and red). This is a more severe case of acne that is also known as cystic acne. Those are those deep, painful ones under the surface of the skin &#8211; sometimes they come to a head and sometimes they don’t but they really hurt when you press on them and they can make your skin swollen in the area.  These are the lesions we as dermatologists are most concerned with because they are the ones that are most likely cause permanent acne scarring We usually try more aggressive treatment with cysts and nodules because these can cause permanent acne scarring.</p>\\n<p><strong>Is there a specific cause?</strong></p>\\n<p>There are a lot of different things that can contribute to acne and breakouts but in general, acne is strongly determined by genetics and hormones. People who have oily skin tend to pass on this tendency for oily skin to their children, and these are the people who tend to get more acne. If a parent had bad acne as a child, their children will more likely have acne. Also, hormones play a huge role which is why acne is most common during puberty, when hormone levels are at their highest. Hormones trigger increased oil production in the skin and cause the acne breakouts. Men tend to get acne mainly during these teenage years when hormones are spiking.  However, adult women can continue to get breakouts and most commonly this is associated with their menstrual cycle, as this is when there is a little bump in hormone levels too.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2955\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20160428/Mario-Badescu-JPG-158x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"158\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20160428/Mario-Badescu-JPG-158x300.jpg 158w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20160428/Mario-Badescu-JPG.jpg 479w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\\\" /> <img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2956\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20160455/USE-JPG-87x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"87\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>We like <a href=\\\"http://www.kiehls.com.au/face-targeted-treatments/breakout-control-targeted-acne-spot-treatment/3605970989156.html#q=acne&amp;start=4\\\">Kiehl&#8217;s breakout Control Targeted Acne Spot Treatment, $39.10</a>.

A clever blend of calamine and salicylic acid soothes and clears whiteheads overnight.</p>\\n<p><strong>And the obvious question, what is the best way to treat them?</strong></p>\\n<p>Acne treatment, as you might imagine, can really vary from case to case. There are over the counter solutions, a lot of different prescription medications (both topical and oral) as well as some Dermatological procedures that can help treat acne. I do encourage you see a dermatologist or GP to really get the most efficient and effective treatment methods, especially if you have more moderate to severe acne or skin conditions. You now have the option of a new topical acne treatment in Australia called <a href=\\\"https://www.aczone.com\\\">ACZONE® 7.5% w/w gel</a>. We have had ACZONE in the US for a few years so I’m pleased you have a new option there. ACZONE’s active ingredient is called dapsone, which is thought to have an anti-inflammatory effect on acne. It does works in both non-inflammatory (comedonal) acne and inflammatory acne.</p>\\n<p>In adult women who have breakouts that coincide with their menstrual cycle, birth control pills that help regulate hormones can also help regulate acne breakouts.  Also, many women have a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) which causes multiple benign cysts to grow on the ovaries and also can increase blood levels of testosterone. In women with PCOS, they most typically have breakouts that occur around the chin and jawline and neck, and can even have a slightly deeper voice, and more hair growth on the chin, jaw and neck.  Actually, it’s not uncommon for a dermatologist to make the diagnosis of PCOS because women come in with breakouts and symptoms that are characteristic of PCOS.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2952\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152324/oil-free-acne-wash-pink-grapefruit-facial-wash-43199-193x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"193\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152324/oil-free-acne-wash-pink-grapefruit-facial-wash-43199-193x300.jpg 193w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152324/oil-free-acne-wash-pink-grapefruit-facial-wash-43199.jpg 644w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px\\\" /> <img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2953\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152651/ACNE_Tinted_Purifying_Spot_Cream_300dpi-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152651/ACNE_Tinted_Purifying_Spot_Cream_300dpi-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152651/ACNE_Tinted_Purifying_Spot_Cream_300dpi-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152651/ACNE_Tinted_Purifying_Spot_Cream_300dpi-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20152651/ACNE_Tinted_Purifying_Spot_Cream_300dpi-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p>Try <a href=\\\"http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/60742/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Acne-Wash-Pink-Grapefruit-Facial-Cleanser-175ml\\\">Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Facial Wash, $14.99</a>.

Mineral pigments conceal redness while benzoyl peroxide fights inflammation.</p>\\n<p>And of course there are also a variety of different in-office procedures that can be done by a skincare professional such as facials and extractions. As a dermatologist I also treat acne patients with chemical peels and laser treatments.  Estheticians often steam the skin first to make blackheads and whiteheads extract more easily, and can apply enzyme treatments to help breakdown the debris within pores so extractions are simpler.  Also, there are laser and light treatments that are popular and effective, but these are often not covered by health insurance.</p>\\n<p><strong>What is the worst thing we can do?</strong></p>\\n<p>Well, you can really make things worse if the pimple doesn’t have a head yet and you try to pop it yourself. If you have a red pimple that hurts to touch, and is deep under the skin, it’s pretty impossible to pop it at that point. Usually this means that the pimple is still under the skin, and trying to extract it can not only be very painful, but you can cause irritation and even infection that will make it harder for the pimple to heal. Worse yet, if you really traumatize the skin, you risk scarring and that is likely permanent. If you feel like products are simply not working for you or you are really experiencing irritation and pain on your skin, you should absolutely see a Dermatologist to get more information and help.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20145953/Dr-PP-Purple-JPG.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"57df70d3-5e1a-54a6-9db5-c7ff2feb36f3\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/dr-pimple-popper-get-rid-acne-good.json\n// module id = 590\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Best Lip Plumpers That Actually Work &#8211; Like, For Real\",\"content\":\"<p>Here at The Beauty Insider we adore a full pout, but then again who doesn&#8217;t? There&#8217;s just something so terribly appealing about a juicy pair of lips. Yes, they&#8217;re sexy (obviously) but it&#8217;s more than that.</p>\\n<p>It isn&#8217;t fair, but a perfect pout suggests youth and vitality and heck &#8211; all things good. Given that, I recently decided I needed one &#8211; and quickly. I don&#8217;t tend to muck about with my beauty (who has the time for that?) and so I booked in for a little dermal filler. Yep. I sure did.</p>\\n<p>In case you&#8217;re not across dermal fillers here&#8217;s a few details for you.</p>\\n<p>Dermal fillers are injectable materials that are used to plump deep lines, augment cheekbones, plump lips (hello!) or fill under-eye hollows. In fact, they can be injected pretty much anywhere you are craving volume.</p>\\n<p>I decided to have a touch injected into my upper lip which was a little thin for my liking. And then I got over-excited (as I tend to) and decided to have my bottom lip done too! Decision made I visited with <a href=\\\"http://privee.com.au/the-team/\\\">registered nurse Natalie Abouchar</a> at<a href=\\\"http://privee.com.au\\\"> Privee Clinic</a> who applied numbing cream to my mouth and then, began injecting.</p>\\n<p>After each tiny pin prick (the filler contains lidocaine so after the first few injections you feel very little) she massaged the filler into the right spot and then &#8211; done. My top lip was no longer a thin line and my bottom lip was full and lovely.</p>\\n<p>That week several people told me I looked fresher than usual. Coincidence? I think not.<br />\\nDermal filler injections vary in price depending on the brand, the salon and how much you use. Generally speaking, filler will cost about $550 for a full ml which could do both top and bottom lip. A full face could cost $2000 or more.</p>\\n<p>If you don&#8217;t fancy injections there are products about that will provide a less permanent effect.

She&#8217;s the woman behind a skincare line that is going from strength to strength. And as such, we wanted to know how it came about, how she got to be where she is and maybe, how we could get there too.</p>\\n<p>So without further ado, please meet <strong>Kim Lewin-Reilly</strong>. She really is quite something (as you&#8217;re about to discover).</p>\\n<p><strong>So the brand &#8230; it got its name how? </strong></p>\\n<p>Well the name <a href=\\\"https://www.lewinandreilly.com/store/\\\">Lewin &amp; Reilly</a> came about because my surname is Lewin and my husband Andi’s surname is Reilly. So I tell everyone that I’m the Lewin and he’s the Reilly.</p>\\n<p><strong>And it started because &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>The idea came when Andi and I were on honeymoon in Aitutaki in the Cook Islands. We were amazed at the botanical produce growing wild there. We felt so incredibly grateful and happy to be in such a beautiful place, eating such fresh, naturally organic produce. It made us want to change our lives and help others to feel that good, healthy and energised.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2917\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203546/mask-JPG-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203546/mask-JPG-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203546/mask-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203546/mask-JPG.jpg 595w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.lewinandreilly.com/product/purity-mask/\\\">The cult classic &#8211; Lewin &amp; Reilly Zeolite &amp; Elderflower Purity Face Mask, $56.</a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>And so we &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>We returned home to Australia from the Cook Islands and began experimenting by making soaps, balms, things that are relatively easy to make because we wanted to translate that feeling of freshness into products that you use on your body. Our research led us to many incredible organic farms and growers, and native botanicals. It really opened our eyes to the fact that Australia has some of the best, most potent and unique native plants in the world, arguably THE best.</p>\\n<p>From this discovery, we could see the need for more transparency in the skin care industry with regards to ingredients and their origin, so we decided on a philosophy for Lewin &amp; Reilly “Luxurious Organic Skin Care from Place to Face”. This is based on the cuisine philosophy of Farm to Table, and this is definitely what makes us stand out.</p>\\n<p><strong>The journey so far has been …</strong></p>\\n<p>Full of important life and business lessons, discovery, hard work, joy, struggles and personal growth. It is a whirlwind of emotions operating your own business, and there are so many tasks to accomplish each and every day. There’s hardly ever a day off, but the payoff in terms of customer satisfaction, personal satisfaction and what you learn along the way just can’t be matched.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2918\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203716/Lewin-Reilly-Organic-Quattro-300x225.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"225\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203716/Lewin-Reilly-Organic-Quattro-300x225.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203716/Lewin-Reilly-Organic-Quattro-768x576.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203716/Lewin-Reilly-Organic-Quattro-1024x768.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.lewinandreilly.com/store-sets/\\\">The Lewin and Reilly Organic Spa Quattro &#8211; balances oily skin and brightens dullness, $223. </a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>You wish more people knew that organic skincare is capable of</strong> …</p>\\n<p>Being more effective than conventional skin care &#8211; if formulated correctly. Organic skin care that has a good range of ingredients; oils, hydrosols, butters, clays, hydrophilic (water-based) plant extracts and lipophyllic (oil-based) plant extracts, plus a good range of products &#8211; cream and oil cleansers, a cream-based moisturiser, a toner/tonic, an oil and/or water-based serum and a combined oil and clay exfoliating mask (not just powder based) will do everything for your skin that conventional skin care promises, but usually does not deliver on. In fact from personal experience, conventional skin care has done nothing but aggravate my skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>You need to remember that &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Not all organic skin care collections are created equal. Some may still use lifeless ingredients purchased many months ago from halfway across the world and will have long since lost their potency. Some may just not have the variety of water-based and oil-based ingredients and products that your skin needs.</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s better for the planet because no pesticides/insecticides are used in the process of growing the ingredients. These are known to have a harmful effect on not only the environment, but arguably the most important species on the planet, bees.

I began working with beauty editors as an assistant/intern whilst studying for a BA in communications. So I’ve really been interested in beauty and skin care for a very long time, even since I was a child. I was fortunate then to have my Dad working as the manager for the food hall in a large department store (Selfridges) in London, where I’d go and visit him every weekend and basically buy skin care in the beauty department at every possible moment. Needless to say, it was not in any way natural or organic!</p>\\n<p><strong>And your husband? How did he get here?</strong></p>\\n<p>Andi formerly worked as a winemaker, and so had the technical knowledge and understanding of chemistry to ignite his interest in making skin care. Although we started with making soaps, that progressed to making balms, and then toners, finally  full-blown moisturisers and serums which are more complex formulation-wise. Andi is an avid reader and loves learning. He has such a variety of skills, and so our business has not only helped him to learn so many new things, but it also utilises his many skills and interests.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19203510/KIM-LW-JPG.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"},{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"52d0b249-398c-5c12-9a21-b0db70af546a\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/woman-made-beauty-business-can.json\n// module id = 592\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Victoria Beckham Has Created A Powerful New Collection For Estee Lauder\",\"content\":\"<p>Victoria Beckham has released a second makeup collection with Estee Lauder and it&#8217;s a powerful one.

These symptoms are usually located around the nose, cheeks, and neck areas. Sensitive skin is also more susceptible to allergic reactions and broken capillaries.</p>\\n<p><strong>Why does it matter if your skin is sensitive?</strong></p>\\n<p>Whilst redness can be masked by make-up, dry and flaking skin won’t. No matter how good your primer and foundation, on close-up the flakiness will remain visible. The only way to address effectively these symptoms is by finding out what has caused them and tackling the issue head on.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you treat it in general?</strong></p>\\n<p>Most of us use many products with multiple ingredients without understanding the interactions between them. I would recommend trying to eliminate one skincare product at a time and monitor any potential improvement in your skin in the following week. If you have eliminated all your skincare products and you skin has not improved, then you must consider lifestyle factors such as your diet. Adults can develop allergies and intolerances. Whilst allergies generate an immune response, food intolerances create chemical reactions which might be more difficult for us to detect. This is something that your GP can help with by performing prick or blood tests to help you find the allergen(s).</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2881\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2881\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies.jpg 1500w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The natural beauty behind the Akhal brand.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Are there ingredients + treatments + steps to avoid?</strong></p>\\n<p>Every individual is different but there are a few triggers which should be avoided for those with sensitive skin such as:<br />\\n<strong>• Highly fragranced products</strong>: Whether it is your night cream, your soap or detergent, the ingredient behind that nice smell might be a skin irritant.

They work on every level to help your skin heal and keep all its three layers moisturised not just its surface<br />\\n<strong>• Harnessing the power of herbs and flowers</strong>. Whether it’s using our Rose hydrosol as a toner to calm and hydrate your skin or drinking healing herbal teas, there are so many plants that are good for your health. My favourite herbal tea includes ginger, lemongrass, calendula, hibiscus, and Moroccan rose petals. It is detoxifying, soothing and I love the taste.</p>\\n<p><strong>Finally, do we have to spend lots of money to keep sensitive skin in good nick?</strong></p>\\n<p>There was a time where I could barely afford food let alone skincare products. That is why I wanted Akhal Beauty products to be affordable. Good organic skincare should be accessible to all! If you really are in a pinch, you could always use ingredients in your fridge. An avocado mask does wonders to your skin and ground oats work great as a gentle daily polish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Other Sensitive Products We Know, Love And Recommend</strong></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2498\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/04071419/trilogy-jpg-262x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"262\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/04071419/trilogy-jpg-262x300.jpg 262w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/04071419/trilogy-jpg.jpg 451w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.trilogyproducts.com/au/products/very-gentle-hydra-mask\\\">Trilogy Very Gentle Hydra-Mask, $37.95.</a></p>\\n<a href=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19213644/Ellier-sensitive.tiff\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2934\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19213644/Ellier-sensitive.tiff\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></a>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.ellier.com.au/products/olive-oil-moisturiser\\\">Ellier Olive Oil Moisturiser, $34.99.</a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2935\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-139x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"139\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-139x300.jpg 139w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-768x1652.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-476x1024.jpg 476w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd.jpg 1537w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/bioderma/bioderma-sensibio-ar-bb-cream-tube-40ml.html\\\">Bioderma Sensibio AR BB Cream, $43.99.</a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2937\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-146x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-146x300.jpg 146w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-768x1582.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-497x1024.jpg 497w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml.jpg 1456w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/82384/Avene-Cleanance-Cleansing-Gel-400ml\\\">Avene Cleanance Cleansing Gel, $29.99.</a></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2992\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22231340/Sukin-two-JPG-300x284.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"284\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22231340/Sukin-two-JPG-300x284.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22231340/Sukin-two-JPG.jpg 424w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://sukinorganics.com/collections/sensitive-skin/products/sensitive-calming-night-cream\\\">Sukin Sensitive Calming Night Cream, $20.95.</a></p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27131622/NicM_1381_RET.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"87da3cb5-d848-5620-a6b2-ca6e08101876\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/soothe-sensitive-skin-looks-gorgeous-feels.json\n// module id = 594\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"The Fashion Girl&#8217;s Guide To All Things Pink And Grey &#8230; Let&#8217;s SHOP!\",\"content\":\"<p>I love a bright, bold colour as much as anyone but when I shop I find myself gravitating towards the softer, more gentle shades, in particular a dusty soft pink and dove grey.</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what a colour specialist or, indeed, even a psychologist would make of that but here&#8217;s my amateur take on the pink and grey attraction. <strong>These two shades are not just stylish, but super soothing</strong>.

Why do you think that is?</strong><br />\\nK-Beauty has a signature look. It&#8217;s all about the glowy complexion and healthy looking skin. I think that is probably what caught people’s attention. It’s something that makes you look beautiful without the need for a lot of makeup. I also think it’s the result of K Pop culture becoming big around the world.</p>\\n<p><strong>What does typical daily skincare look like for your average Korean woman?</strong><br />\\nA lot of it comes from Korea’s traditional and very popular sauna culture. Today in Korea, clinic skincare appointments are very popular and form part of everyday life for many women. We bring that home too. We use products every day such as masks. The sheet mask originated in Korea. Korean women have one on every night, not just occasionally. Korean women know that the most important thing to do is to keep skin hydrated.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2849 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235356/JPG-Donkey-300x253.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"253\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235356/JPG-Donkey-300x253.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235356/JPG-Donkey-768x648.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235356/JPG-Donkey.jpg 904w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/16-brand/donkey-milk-cream/I-027691.html?cgpath=brands-16bran#start=1\\\">16 brand Donkey Milk Cream, $29.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>What do you love most about K-beauty?</strong><br />\\nThe passion. Korean women are very passionate about skincare and makeup. Chosungah Beauty (which includes Chosungah 22 and 16 Brand) revolves around ignoring blemishes and/or perceived flaws. We don&#8217;t want you to focus on anything negative or feel sad. We&#8217;re all about celebrating the good things, the beautiful features you have and highlighting those.</p>\\n<p><strong>What did you learn about beauty as a girl and who taught you?</strong><br />\\nAs a child I would spend a lot of time playing with makeup products and when my friends would come over, I would dress them up and do their makeup and we would play beauty pageants in my living room. It was very much a part of my everyday life!</p>\\n<p><strong>Favourite international beauty muse?</strong><br />\\nAudrey Hepburn but not so much in her prime but when she was older. The way she kept herself beautiful is something that definitely inspires me.

I’ve noticed women out for a run and exercising and it really reflects quality of life. Beauty isn’t just about putting on makeup but is about all aspects of your life. You are so lucky that you seem to enjoy lots of outdoor activity, good sunlight and I’m sure your SPF and moisturising is important. Australians match very well to our brand message of ‘mind beauty’.</p>\\n<p><strong>Fav three products of all time?</strong><br />\\nMy Chosungah 22 Bounce Up Pact Powder Foundation, C&amp;T Blender and the 16Brand Fingerpen.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2842 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06233707/JPG-bounce--235x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"235\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06233707/JPG-bounce--235x300.jpg 235w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06233707/JPG-bounce-.jpg 722w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/chosungah22/bounce-up-pact-powder-foundation/V-025676.html?cgpath=brands-chosun#start=1\\\">Chosungah22 Bounce Up Pact Powder Foundation, $45.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Korean beauty product we need in our lives?</strong><br />\\nOur new Donkey Milk Cream from 16Brand, because skin care is so important in your routine and this product incorporates the best of both worlds in terms of it being effective skincare but also giving you a beautiful finished look.</p>\\n<p><strong>What is in your handbag right now?</strong><br />\\nI have pulled it all apart at the moment but I always carry around our Dual Lip Tint Gloss, C&amp;T Blender and a 16Brand Fingerpen.

She knows stuff.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>What makes this product so good?</strong></p>\\n<p>Apart from the fact that it’s very cheap and seriously works as well as more expensive concealers, I think a big reason this is popular is because of the range of shades. There are 25 of them, so it suits all skin types and is really versatile in that you can use it to conceal, correct, contour or simply brighten.</p>\\n<p>Colour correctors tend to be products where you can generally get away with a cheaper price. They’re worn under your top layers of make-up, so if blended and set correctly, they have a greater likelihood of living up to their claims of being long-lasting – compared to foundations and powders.</p>\\n<p>But be careful to watch for creasing and don’t overdo it! <strong>LA Girl Concealers</strong> tend to have more pigmentation, which is great for the life of the product (as you need less per use) but if you use too much of one colour, you can look like a bit like abstract art.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2779\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2779\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30133319/LAGIRL1-300x171.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"171\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30133319/LAGIRL1-300x171.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30133319/LAGIRL1-768x437.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30133319/LAGIRL1.jpg 800w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Yes. It IS magical! Well, terribly good anyway.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you pick the right shade?</strong></p>\\n<p>If you’re just dabbling in correctors, the more outrageous shades can be frightening but I assure you, it’s far easier than it seems.</p>\\n<p>Firstly, take a look in the mirror and work out what you want to cover up. The general rule of thumb is to pick the opposite colour, and if you’re really not sure just Google ‘corrector colour wheel’ images and use that as a guide.</p>\\n<p>Typically, people want to either <strong>cover dark circles under their eyes or red marks and blemishes</strong>. Or both, and you can use multiple colours.</p>\\n<p>For <strong>dark circles</strong>, go for an orange or depending on how dark your skin tone is a red concealer. This cancels out the blue and purple undertones of the circles.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2784\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2784\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30134130/colour-wheel-JPG-300x287.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"287\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30134130/colour-wheel-JPG-300x287.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30134130/colour-wheel-JPG.jpg 453w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">You&#8217;ll find handy info like this.

I also like to finish my look with a purple-based powder, to help brighten the face all over.</p>\\n<p>If that’s too advanced, just go for one that looks natural, or with yellow undertones, that is one or two shades lighter than your skin tones. These are more universal and you can use it to cover up <strong>under-eye circles, age spots, freckles and pesky pimples</strong>.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30133130/LAGIRL2.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"c1770f62-b17f-53a1-9354-1ec67055307f\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/11-concealer-beauty-influencer-fave-need-one.json\n// module id = 599\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Brow Queen Amy-Jean Linnehan On Building A Beauty Empire\",\"content\":\"<p>Once upon a time we plucked our own eyebrows &#8211; often with disastrous results.

Apply it three quarters of the way to the brow bone.</p>\\n<p>Continue to layer the colour to make it darker.

I figured the quickest way to answer the questions I hear the most, is to pop them down in one hit.</p>\\n<p>So, here&#8217;s a handful of Qs I do get asked a lot and, conveniently enough, a handful of answers to go with them.</p>\\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been a beauty editor for a long time.

I wanted to be more poetic in my writing style and car crashes and council meeting follow-ups don’t allow for much of that!</p>\\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong><br />\\nI’m a little bit rock chick I would think. I tend to wear not too much makeup at all. But I love a luminescent cheek and a berry stained mouth. Natural and fresh I would think … Who knows? It’s very hard to assess yourself realistically ..

I was the Beauty and Health Director there for many years. Isn&#8217;t Ros gorgeous? She&#8217;s 50. Amazing.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>What three beauty products won’t you leave home without?<br />\\n</strong>I never go anywhere without a tube of the Aussie cult lip product <a href=\\\"http://www.lanolips.com\\\"><strong>Lanolips</strong></a>. My favourite shade is Rhubarb but as long as I have a tube I’m easy. I also like a tinted moisturiser and a cream blush.

It’s gorgeous plus has a generous mirror.</p>\\n<p><strong>What makes you an expert anyway?</strong><br />\\nI’m not sure I would use those words to describe myself but I have worked as a journalist since I was 17 years old. I started off in hard news in a very tough, old-fashioned newspaper where I was trained and in the toughest of ways. If I made a mistake I paid for it in blood. It was a hard gig and I went home to my parents and cried every single weekend but I can now string a perfectly grammatical sentence together and I know damn well how to stage a decent interview and write an excellent piece.</p>\\n<a href=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010902/profile-shot.tiff\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-2689 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010902/profile-shot.tiff\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></a>\\n<p><em>This is me with the genius beauty guru <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/alphiesadsad/\\\">Alphie Sadsad of Bobbi Brown</a>. He did my makeup before filming at Channel Nine. I think I was appearing on A Current Affair. Obviously I look amazing &#8211; because he is a god.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>Have you had any serious standout moments? Met anyone amazing?</strong></p>\\n<p>I have been working in this field for most of my life and I still love the pants off it! Beauty is, bottom line, fun. And yes, it is frivolous. No doubt. It’s a long way from neurosurgery … but it has the capacity to change the way people see themselves, to lift their mood and to allow themselves to feel beautiful. To me, that means everything.<br />\\nMy highlights always relate to that … They revolve around seeing a very regular person being transformed, watching them leave a makeover with their shoulders straight and their chin up and their soul smiling. Who wouldn’t want to be around that ever day?</p>\\n<p>And sure &#8211; I&#8217;ve met some very, very famous people but the ones that stand out the most to me are actually the regular women I meet when I&#8217;m hosting events.</p>\\n<p><strong>Name your three fave beauty treatments?</strong><br />\\nIt’s not a terribly exciting list but I will not go without a <strong>gel nail pedicure</strong>. I generally go with OPI because the quality is amazing and the colour range is incredible although I always choose the same shade &#8211; <a href=\\\"https://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/big-apple-red-132035590-132047920\\\">Big Apple Red.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Lash extensions. Always!</strong><br />\\nI try and give them up but I just never, ever can. They’re such an easy way to look pretty without making any effort at all! If I’m careful and don’t sleep on my face I can get a good two months out of them too.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2690\\\" style=\\\"width: 242px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2690\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011123/me-JPG-242x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"242\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011123/me-JPG-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011123/me-JPG.jpg 477w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image: Instagram/@the_beautyinsider</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><em>I wear lash extensions pretty much always.

She is so very, very good at what she does. Also, she&#8217;s hilarious. Just saying.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>Botox!</strong><br />\\nIf I have the money (heck, even if I don’t) this is the beauty treatment I do not skip. Just a little to soften the lines across the forehead and my crow’s feet.</p>\\n<p><strong>Anything you really don&#8217;t like or do you love it all?</strong><br />\\nI’m not a fan of body wraps. You know where they layer you up with something, wrap you like a burrito and then wander away and leave you for what seems like forever while you sweat and wriggle and count sheep.

It&#8217;s very hard to find but I&#8217;m okay &#8230; I&#8217;ve got maybe half a dozen bottles stashed. That should last me a while. Shouldn&#8217;t it?</em></p>\\n<p><strong>Favourite scent right now?</strong><br />\\nMy all-time favourite fragrance is Womanity by Thierry Mugler. It’s not easy to come by and I suspect that’s because it’s not a big seller. It’s one of those scents that people either utterly adore or loathe. It makes me weak at the knees. One spritz is all I need. It makes me feel incredibly sexy, powerful and sophisticated all at the same time.</p>\\n<p><b>Is being Beauty Editor as amazing as it looks? </b><br />\\nThe biggest high is definitely the people involved. The women I work with are like my very irritatingly pretty sisters! We do also get to do some very luxurious things … certainly not things I could afford to do if I didn’t work in this industry.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2693\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2693\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG-300x297.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"297\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG-300x297.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG.jpg 598w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image: Instagram/@the_beautyinsider</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><em>Like check this girl out for instance.

From cabin air, the foods we eat, general travel stress and sleep deprivation. It’s no wonder we exit from customs looking far from fresh. But there are some simple tips we can try to keep the glow in our skin after our flight.”</p>\\n<p><strong>Tracey’s tips for long-haul flights include:</strong></p>\\n<p>Upgrade your moisturiser to a richer cream for longer flights as well as a good hydration serum. Add sparingly a small amount of your favourite hydration mask around the eye area to help last the distance of your flight and keep those fine lines exaggerated by dehydration away.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2648 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-242x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"242\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-768x952.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-826x1024.jpg 826w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\\\" />\\n<p>We like a little <a href=\\\"https://www.priceline.com.au/freezeframe-boost-serum-12-ml\\\">Freezeframe Boost Serum, $59</a>. Feels awesome and makes skin fresh and glowing and (bonus!) firm.</p>\\n<p>Try to avoid the above air nozzle blasting directly on our face by turning it slightly to an angle away from the face and on a low setting. This will also help overcome dry, sore eyes which also make us look and feel worse.</p>\\n<p>Opt for a herbal tea or plain water – your skin will thank you for it when you land.

Windows on planes do not block UVA rays associated with wrinkling and skin ageing. The dose of UVA is also much stronger at 20,000 feet. Apply a good protective daily moisturizer 50+ or block out before your flight that will last up to 24 hours as a safe measure. Close the window blind to avoid the sun’s rays when permitted.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2643 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-120x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"120\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-120x300.jpg 120w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-768x1920.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-410x1024.jpg 410w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd.jpg 1400w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/en/davidjones/sunactive-spf-50-mineral-defence--face---body-xop\\\">Ultraceuticals SunActive SPF50+ Mineral Defence Face &amp; Body Lotion, $59.</a></p>\\n<p>Keep the under-eye area well hydrated with a good hydration serum or energising hydration mask by dotting sparingly around the eye area.

They’re forgetting that skin does not end at the jawline.<br />\\n“Your face stops at your boobs,” says <strong>Zoe Foster-Blake</strong>, creator of the <a href=\\\"http://www.gotoskincare.com\\\">skincare line Go-To</a> and author of the <strong>beauty bible Amazing Face (Penguin).</strong><br />\\n“Not at your chin or jawline or where your neck meets your décolletage. At your boobs.”<br />\\nThat’s maybe a little more blunt than we might have been, but Zoe is onto something. We take a great deal of care with our skin, but many of us forget to extend our skincare to our necks and also décolletage.<br />\\nThis is a mistake.

My skincare regime consisted pretty much of soap, water and sunscreen and even that was on the slap dash side of things.<br />\\nMy sisters and I didn’t do moisturiser as such, but massaging oil into our faces and bodies was as standard as brushing our teeth. That came to a halt when in my late teens I moved to the US and my beauty knowledge expanded exponentially. I was told oil was not cool and so I gave it up and fast.<br />\\nBut in recent years oils have made an epic comeback and suddenly even the most high-end brands have one in the lineup. Might my teenage hippy habit be good for skin after all? I put this (and several other) curly questions to skincare pro <strong>Emma Hobson, Education Manager for the International Dermal Institute and Dermalogica.</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Oils were out. Now they’re in. How come?</strong><br />\\nThe resurgence of using plant oils has come about in two key areas of skin care, firstly with the introduction and great popularity of cleansing oils which are fantastic deep cleansing mediums. They work on the principle that like attracts like (oil attracts oil). Therefore, when you wash off the water soluble cleansing oil, you thoroughly wash away all the dirt and surface oils leaving the skin super clean. Secondly the introduction of the new super serums, many of which contain a mixture of plant oils, blended with silicones and age-fighting peptides.</p>\\n<p><strong>My skin gets shiny. Won’t applying oil make that worse?</strong><br />\\nLight plant-based oils absorb quickly and effectively and don’t leave an oily residue. All skin types can use an oil, but you do need to be careful about which oil you choose and how often you use it. My general rule of thumb is the more dehydrated the skin, the more frequently you can use the oil.</p>\\n<p><strong>Apply oil to skin &#8230; Seriously?</strong><br />\\nPlant oils have been used for centuries to help heal and protect skin. The oil works as an emollient (moisturiser). It helps to protect the barrier function and many contain protective anti-oxidants. The majority of oils for the face and body are vegetable or plant derived. These oils are generally nourishing for the skin as they’re an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids.</p>\\n<p>So there you have it. Oils are good. End of. Here, our current faves.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2598 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17142302/JPG-Origins-oil-187x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"187\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17142302/JPG-Origins-oil-187x300.jpg 187w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17142302/JPG-Origins-oil.jpg 568w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/origins/modern-friction-cleansing-oil-with-radiance-boosting-white-purple-rice/I-027481.html#q=cleansing%2Boil&amp;start=1\\\">Origins Modern Friction Cleansing Oil With Radiance-Boosting White &amp; Purple Rice, $42.</a></p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2584 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-232x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"232\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-232x300.jpg 232w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-768x993.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-792x1024.jpg 792w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.aveda.com.au/product/5211/34716/body/tension-relief/beautifying-creme-cleansing-oil/index.tmpl\\\">Aveda Beautifying Creme Cleansing Oil, $39.</a></p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2585 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16141027/CleansingOil_LM-225x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"225\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16141027/CleansingOil_LM-225x300.jpg 225w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16141027/CleansingOil_LM-768x1024.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10051&amp;productId=2132031&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;cm_mmc=googlesem-_-PLA-_-Health+and+Beauty+-+Personal+Care-_-La+Mer+The+Cleansing+Oil+200ml&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI47fnrP2M1QIVh4uPCh3Q7gtjEAQYASABEgJVWfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\\\">La Mer The Cleansing Oil, $112.</a></p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2583 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-212x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"212\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-212x300.jpg 212w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-768x1086.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-724x1024.jpg 724w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.priceline.com.au/simple-kind-to-skin-hydrating-cleansing-oil-125-ml\\\">Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil, $9.99.</a></p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2580 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-103x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"103\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-103x300.jpg 103w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-768x2246.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-350x1024.jpg 350w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd.jpg 1394w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.priceline.com.au/palmer-s-ultra-gentle-facial-cleansing-oil-192-ml\\\">Palmer’s Skin Therapy Facial Cleansing Oil, $14.99.</a></p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16143043/JPG-La-Mer-Instagram.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"c523e683-bc5e-5e1a-a9fc-557e856e57d9\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/guide-best-cleansing-oils.json\n// module id = 611\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"The Hot New Makeup Trend Of 2017 &#8211; Say Goodbye To Contouring\",\"content\":\"<p>Just this week I heard about <strong>‘nontouring’</strong>.

No darker shades in the hollows of your cheeks, no lighter shades at the high points of the cheekbones &#8211; just one flattering shade that works for you.</p>\\n<p>Do I care? Well, a little bit &#8211; but um &#8230; maybe not as much as you might think. The thing to note about this is that beauty trends come and go all the time. My advice &#8211;<strong> choose those that make you feel beautiful</strong> and stick with them as long as you like. Yep. Even if they&#8217;re officially done and dusted. Whether Kim Kardashian is on board is neither here nor there.</p>\\n<p>So, in all seriousness, while <strong>&#8216;nontouring&#8217;</strong> is supposedly going to be the next big thing it really doesn&#8217;t matter. Because you, my lovely friends, can rock any lock your heart desires. That said, if <strong>nontouring</strong> sounds good to you, here&#8217;s a couple of products that will help you bring that look to life.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2563 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220541/Nontouring-UB-JPG-300x210.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"210\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220541/Nontouring-UB-JPG-300x210.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220541/Nontouring-UB-JPG-768x536.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220541/Nontouring-UB-JPG.jpg 839w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/urban-decay/naked-skin-shapeshifter/V-027369.html?cgpath=whatsnew-makeup#start=1\\\">Urban Decay Naked Skin Shapeshifter, $70. </a>Yes, it&#8217;s actually designed for contouring, but, you can stick with just one to three shades and create a lovely, natural, nontoured look too.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2564 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220707/Smashbox-JPG-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220707/Smashbox-JPG-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220707/Smashbox-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220707/Smashbox-JPG-768x767.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220707/Smashbox-JPG.jpg 920w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/smashbox/baked-fusion-soft-lights/I-007611.html\\\">Smashbox Baked Fusion Soft Lights, $46.</a> Boost radiance and add glow all over with this silk-like powder.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2565 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220749/LM-Candleglow-Foundation-1-150x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220749/LM-Candleglow-Foundation-1-150x300.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220749/LM-Candleglow-Foundation-1-768x1536.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220749/LM-Candleglow-Foundation-1-512x1024.jpg 512w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08220749/LM-Candleglow-Foundation-1.jpg 900w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/en/davidjones/candleglow-foundation\\\">Laura Mercier Candleglow Foundation, $65.</a> Ultra-lightweight, sheer to medium formula that glides on leaving skin hydrated and glowing.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08221038/LM-Insta-J.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"e65c517b-6089-5e79-9d47-6dca9c4492ac\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/super-pretty-new-beauty-trend-replacing-contouring-darling-thats-yesterday.json\n// module id = 612\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Why The Swisse Manuka Honey Detoxifying Facial Mask Is A Best-Seller\",\"content\":\"<p><a href=\\\"https://swisse.com/en-au/products/skincare/face/swisse-manuka-honey-detoxifying-facial-mask\\\">The Swisse Manuka Detoxifying Facial Mask</a> is sourced from pure natural ingredients &#8211; and in Australia, we love that. We love it even more if it actually works! And Manuka honey really does.</p>\\n<p>A little detail &#8230; Manuka honey is native to New Zealand and is produced by the bees that pollinate the Manuka bush. Topically, this honey is known for its soothing and healing properties and has been used by traditional societies for hundreds of years.</p>\\n<p>Over at <a href=\\\"https://swisse.com/en-au/home\\\">Swisse</a> they combined this star ingredient with kaolin clay and charcoal, both of which help to <strong>help detoxify skin from impurities and reduce the appearance of large skin pores</strong>,&#8221; says Swisse Technical Manager Innovation, Antoinette-Louise Barnardo.</p>\\n<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s a quality product that sells for an awesome price and Australian beauty fanatics know it. Hence the number one in pharmacy status.</p>\\n<p>On the topic of masks &#8211; boy are they popular right now. And here&#8217;s why. <strong>Masks are incredibly beneficial</strong> &#8211; and not just for boosting your Instagram feed. You see, masks are intensely soaked in (if they’re of the sheet variety) or made up of (the smooth on type) high levels of active ingredients &#8211; the kind that actually create a change in skin as opposed to just sit on top of it.</p>\\n<p>Think<strong> vitamins A, C or niacinamide</strong> for example -all proven anti-agers. Others are based on ingredients such as charcoal (which draws out dirt and grime) or hyaluronic acid (which provides deep moisture).<br />\\nGiven that, there are masks out there that can ease sun spots, increase moisture levels, smooth and soften. They can reduce oily patches and minimise the appearance of pores too. And they can do so in just 10 to 15 minutes. Look out!</p>\\n<p>The secondary benefit (and it’s a big one), masks force you to take a moment to do nothing. And this <strong>is every bit as beneficial</strong> for your skin (and wellbeing) as the mask itself.</p>\\n<p>We recommend you try one today. Go on. Take 10 to 15 minutes for yourself. And gain a beauty benefit or three while you’re at it. Yes, we love the Swisse Manuka version, but if that doesn&#8217;t take your fancy there&#8217;s a swag of others to choose from. Here, a handful of our current faves.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2543 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211020/the-lifting-and-firming-mask-71445-214x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"214\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211020/the-lifting-and-firming-mask-71445-214x300.jpg 214w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211020/the-lifting-and-firming-mask-71445-768x1077.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211020/the-lifting-and-firming-mask-71445-730x1024.jpg 730w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211020/the-lifting-and-firming-mask-71445.jpg 1050w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.cremedelamer.com.au/product/9088/30156/masks/the-lifting-and-firming-mask\\\">La Mer The Lifting and Firming Mask, $330</a>. The formula contains La Mer&#8217;s famed nutrient-rich Miracle Broth and the potent Lifting Ferment to visibly tighten and refine the face and neck.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2544 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211109/Even-Better-Brightening-Moisture-Mask-134x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"134\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211109/Even-Better-Brightening-Moisture-Mask-134x300.jpg 134w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211109/Even-Better-Brightening-Moisture-Mask-768x1719.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/08211109/Even-Better-Brightening-Moisture-Mask-457x1024.jpg 457w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.clinique.com.au/product/1682/30260/skin-care/exfoliatorsmasks/even-better-brightening-moisture-mask\\\">Clinique Even Better Brightening Mask, $52</a>.

Her range is housed in glass bottles etched with positive affirmations too.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;My range promotes daily rituals where can we lavish our skin and body with divine smelling nourishing ingredients to support the health of our skin, but also nurture our spirit and promote feelings of self worth,&#8221; she explains.</p>\\n<p>And we are totally on board with that.</p>\\n<p>Because the thing is, skincare can only do so much, even when scientifically formulated and with top-quality ingredients.

We&#8217;ve made that clear. But at heart, we like our skincare products to be a little high-tech and the idea that this range contains <a href=\\\"https://alyssumalchemy.com.au/collections/sacred-skincare/products/queen-of-roses-gift-pack\\\">rose quartz </a>is cool but it did make us wonder &#8230; Does it really serve any purpose?</p>\\n<p>Alison says absolutely. And she explains it like this.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Everything is energy,&#8221; she says.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our intentions, our food, our space, our emotions, the things we touch and smell, they all vibrate at a certain frequency. Einstein was the first to reveal this through his research.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Crystals have a unique crystalline structure which gives them a vibrational integrity supportive for healing. I also believe using crystals helps us to feel more connected to the earth (as crystals have all come from deep within the earth).&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Sounds pretty valid to us. But it was this last piece of info that really won us over.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The colour of rose quartz, a soft pink, aligns with the heart chakra which governs compassion, healing and trust,&#8221; says Alison.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;By infusing my skincare range with this crystal, the products emit the healing frequency of rose quartz which can aid feelings of self worth, balance the heart chakra and increase compassion.&#8221;</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2425\\\" style=\\\"width: 226px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2425\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-226x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"226\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-226x300.jpg 226w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-770x1024.jpg 770w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG.jpg 951w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Made with quality stuff &#8211; and a whole lot of love too.</figcaption></figure>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24213250/Alison.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"},{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"2042c38a-0101-5ec9-8726-b05d30465280\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/kooky-new-skincare-trend-might-just-change-life-skin.json\n// module id = 618\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"The Three Beauty Trends That Are Blowing Up Right Now\",\"content\":\"<p>We researched long and hard, left no beauty drawer unrifled and no beauty department unvisited.

For real.<br />\\nFrankly, I’ll be surprised if I ever get a traditional wax again.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2433\\\" style=\\\"width: 274px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2433\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25205746/Kristinamendonca-JPG-bike-274x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"274\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25205746/Kristinamendonca-JPG-bike-274x300.jpg 274w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25205746/Kristinamendonca-JPG-bike.jpg 543w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Bye bye hair!

Together, we&#8217;re going to sort the facts from the fiction. Ready? here we go.</p>\\n<p><strong>Muscle Freezers</strong></p>\\n<p>Muscle freezing treatments such as Botox and Dysport vary in cost from $10 to $20 or more a unit. Smoothing lines on the forehead will require roughly 10 to 20 units. Treating ‘crow’s feet’, the lines at the outside corners of the eyes, will take about the same amount.<br />\\nAsk for an estimated price before you commit.<br />\\nBotox and Dysport are brand names only. The two products differ with many practitioners selling Dysport for less, but using more of it. Some clients get longer-lasting results with one brand and therefore tend to stick with it. Ask your practitioner which brand they prefer and also why.<br />\\nRemember also that while they are minor, there are risks involved. Incorrect needle placement can see the wrong muscles relaxed, which can cause eye droop. And it&#8217;s not pretty.</p>\\n<p>This has never happened to us here at The Beauty Insider and that&#8217;s with a good decade of muscle freezing treatments. And it is very, very rare. That said, it HAS happened to plenty of our closest girlfriends. If it does happen to you, you can take comfort in the fact that the treatment only lasts about three months so you will not have to suffer forever.</p>\\n<p>Further, a good cosmetic doctor may be able to place other injections in other areas in order to lessen the effect.</p>\\n<p>Our verdict on the whole? This is a terrific treatment that we have no trouble recommending. That said, be careful who does the work for you. You want to look fresh, not frozen.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2414\\\" style=\\\"width: 279px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2414\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24212037/nurianieva-JPG-279x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"279\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24212037/nurianieva-JPG-279x300.jpg 279w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24212037/nurianieva-JPG.jpg 476w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image: Instagram/@nurianieva &#8211; fresh, fresh, not frozen.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><strong>Fillers</strong></p>\\n<p>Fillers cost considerably more than muscle freezers, but you require considerably less of the product itself. One ampoule would resolve lines around the mouth for example. A single ampoule will cost about $500 to $600. Many clinics offer a full-face treatment for roughly $1500.<br />\\nThe costs will vary greatly depending on how much product you opt for, and which brand your practitioner uses.<br />\\nAgain, ask which brand is being used and why. Also, inquire about possible bruising and other potential side effects.</p>\\n<p>Many fillers come with a numbing ingredient such as Lidocaine meaning that the area will become numb after the first injection. This will help to lessen any discomfort. You can also try ice or an anti-anxiety tablet such as Valium or Xanax if your doctor is able to provide these.</p>\\n<p>Finally, some practitioners offer &#8216;laughing&#8217; gas in order to take the edge off. On the whole though this is a very tolerable treatment. The one area it can be quite painful is the lips. If you&#8217;re after a full pout and are planning on getting filler injected in this area we recommend a dental block beforehand.</p>\\n<p>We&#8217;ve tried with and without and can report that with a dental block is way more enjoyable!</p>\\n<p>Our verdict on fillers? They&#8217;re an excellent way to provide volume to areas of the face that have lost fat due to age and also, areas of the face you&#8217;d like to enhance such as your mouth and also, your cheekbones.</p>\\n<p>Again, we recommend a little, not a lot. You want to look like you, only enhanced, says <a href=\\\"http://allsaintsskinclinic.com.au\\\">natural beauty specialist Dr Joseph Hkeik.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>One Last Word &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Risks of both types of treatment will be minimised if you opt for a practitioner who is a qualified medical doctor or is supervised by one. It’s also a good idea to see someone who has a reputation for being a skilled injectable specialist rather than someone who dabbles in injectables on the side.<br />\\nBeware of anyone who advertises or discounts heavily, advises <a href=\\\"http://drvanpark.com.au\\\">cosmetic specialist Dr Van Park</a>.<br />\\n“There’s a reason they have to do that,” says Dr Park, who believes word of mouth is the best advertising there is.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24211238/KimmyK-Kylie-JPG.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"fc6dd94c-1439-5aa4-8293-6cbf23b33a54\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/quick-factual-guide-injectables-facts-no-myths.json\n// module id = 620\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Former Friends Star Courteney Cox Talks Cosmetic Surgery Regrets\",\"content\":\"<p>She&#8217;s best known for her role as 20-something Monica in the hit TV series Friends, but Courteney Cox is actually a grown-up 53.

Those legs, that cleavage, her mesmerising smile, but most of all that incredible dewy, fresh, glowing skin.</p>\\n<p>The woman is 50 years old and yet she could easily pass for half that. Sure, she&#8217;s been blessed with awesome genes, but she&#8217;s also taken great care of her skin &#8211; and so she looks like she does.<br />\\nIf you fancy a little bit of that for yourself, (and damn, who doesn&#8217;t?), here&#8217;s a few simple steps you&#8217;ll want to start including in your skincare regime.</p>\\n<p><strong>Say No To The Sun</strong><br />\\nThe first and most important step &#8211; protect yourself from the sun’s harsh rays.<br />\\nThis means applying roughly 1/4 of a teaspoon of a high-level sunscreen (we’re talking no less than an SPF of 30+) to your face. You’ll also need to apply that same amount again to your neck and again to your chest if it’s going to be exposed to the sun.<br />\\nDon’t think makeup or BB creams with SPF built-in are enough. They’re not.<br />\\n“You won’t use enough and you won’t apply it evenly enough,” says <a href=\\\"http://www.gotoskincare.com\\\">Zoe Foster Blake</a>, founder of Go To Skincare and author of Amazinger Face (Penguin).<br />\\n“By all means use foundation with SPF, but layer it on top of broad-spectrum sun protection,” she says.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2344\\\" style=\\\"width: 239px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2344\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16220938/JPG-Halle-arm-239x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"239\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16220938/JPG-Halle-arm-239x300.jpg 239w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16220938/JPG-Halle-arm.jpg 475w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image: Instagram/@halleberry</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><strong>Care For Your Skin</strong><br />\\nEach morning cleanse skin thoroughly. Skip the foaming cleansers and those that double as scrubs. Both types are likely to be too harsh for mature skin. Instead, opt for cream versions or cleansing oils, which are more gentle.<br />\\nOnce skin is cleansed each morning apply a treatment serum. Use one that is specifically designed to treat any issues you have such as redness, pigmentation or signs of ageing. Allow at least five, preferably 10 minutes for your serum to fully penetrate the skin and be absorbed (otherwise you risk wiping it off during this next step). Then, apply a quality moisturiser with an SPF of 30+ or more. Opt for one that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Remember to do your neck and chest too if needed. You might like to apply cream to your hands also.<br />\\nEach evening repeat the process. However, swap your moisturiser for one that’s designed specifically for night-time use.

Yes it will may feel a little strange (at least at first) but this practise is thought to boost feelings of wellbeing and self esteem.<br />\\nIt may also pay to remind yourself that the concept of the ‘ideal’ woman that we see in movies, on TV and in many magazines is often unrealistic and unachievable for just about everyone. And, there’s this &#8230; recent research published by the British Psychological Society shows that the majority of women who use skincare and makeup do so not to look younger, but to look ‘good’ and ‘to feel confident’. Why not be one of them.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16220854/JPG-Halle-hair.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"},{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"c0f48be9-3e82-5a2b-be1c-fc9569d0cca0\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/stay-young-forever-halle-berry-can-can.json\n// module id = 625\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"I&#8217;m A Woman And I Shaved My Face And It Was Maybe The Worst Thing Ever\",\"content\":\"<p>No doubt you&#8217;ve already heard that shaving your face is kind of a thing. At least according to the internet where many makeup and skincare trends seem to find fame. Unicorn hair complete with horn being the perfect example!</p>\\n<p>But back to the trend of women shaving their face. Because we&#8217;re talking about women here &#8211; obviously.</p>\\n<p>And here&#8217;s my two cents&#8217; worth on the topic. Skip it. Yes it removes hair (duh) and yes, just like its devotees claim, it will take off a tiny layer of old skin cells meaning skin that is super fresh and exfoliated (for a short while), but so will many over-the-counter products that are no more costly than these magical women&#8217;s face-shaving razors and also, more effective in terms of removing dead skin cells and more importantly, considerably less dangerous.</p>\\n<p>And then there&#8217;s this handy little factoid. Facial hair, especially the downy soft peach fuzz most women have, grows back pretty much immediately and that sexy stubble that your BF rocks each morning? Well, guess what &#8211; you&#8217;ll have it too.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1105 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02153417/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-e1488432891529-242x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"242\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02153417/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-e1488432891529-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02153417/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-e1488432891529.jpg 621w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Stubble &#8230; sexy on him, but not on you.</strong></p>\\n<p>As any dermatologist worth their salt will tell you, your former touch of baby fluff will not grow back in with more gusto, more dark or more coarse. But I swear to god it feels like it and if your hair has a dark root it looks all the world like regular bloke re-growth. In a word (well two actually) not pretty.</p>\\n<p>When I tried it I must admit I was a bit chuffed with myself &#8211; momentarily. Shiny, fresh, hair-free skin is sweet as. But the thing is the effects are temporary and after a few days my skin felt more rough and also more dry. Not exactly what I had in mind.</p>\\n<p>So here&#8217;s my verdict. For hair removal I recommend plain old-fashioned waxing or threading. For exfoliating effects try products that contain low levels of alpha hydroxy acids. And leave the razor to your guy.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2336 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08231506/JPG-razor-158x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"158\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08231506/JPG-razor-158x300.jpg 158w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08231506/JPG-razor.jpg 330w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 158px) 100vw, 158px\\\" />\\n<p>If you must give it a try word on the street is that best razor for the job is by <a href=\\\"https://www.shiseido.com.au\\\">Shiseido</a> pictured here.

Kudos.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>Number Two &#8211; Never Compare or Judge</strong><br />\\nOne of the greatest challenges in life is to let go of comparing yourself to others, says Laura.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Remember that we have no idea what is going on behind closed doors and I’m fairly certain you can guarantee they will have a lot of the same stuff going on as you,&#8221; says Laura.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;They perhaps just deal with it or mask it better. It’s ok to strive to be like someone you admire, but when doing this keep your attention on the attributes you wish to emulate and look at it as an opportunity to grow. When you find your inner chatter telling yourself that you don’t have what they have, simply add the word ‘yet’ onto the sentence: “I don’t have what they have yet” – this will switch your brain out of ‘beat-up’ mode and into problem-solving mode so you can figure out how to get there and move forward.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2305\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152751/JPG-235x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"235\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152751/JPG-235x300.jpg 235w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152751/JPG.jpg 346w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\\\" /><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2306\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152808/goals-JPG-300x221.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"221\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152808/goals-JPG-300x221.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152808/goals-JPG.jpg 499w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p>Research that goals are more likely to be achieved when they&#8217;re noted down. A beautiful notebook will that make task a pleasure. For this one and more visit <a href=\\\"http://www.kikki-k.com/notebooks-journals/inspiration-journal\\\">Kikki-k.com</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Number Three &#8211; Celebrate Your Success </strong><br />\\nAlthough you are indeed a strong independent woman (or man), your subconscious brain is still kind of child-like, explains Laura. You need to speak to it nicely and tell it when it’s doing a good job, then it is much more likely to play nice and do more of the good stuff. This is classic positive reinforcement. If you consistently speak badly to it and make it feel like a failure, the chances are it will act up and become defiant, she says.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;So start rewarding yourself and celebrating every time something goes well – I guarantee it will make you feel great and motivate you to keep moving forward to do even more next time… and then confidence is inevitable,&#8221; she adds.</p>\\n<p>This doesn’t have to mean you bring out the champagne every time you make a sale or have a great conversation with a team member &#8211; simply make a point of telling your inner child it’s doing good.</p>\\n<p>So in summary, the key thing that confident women do daily is actually make it all about them. Rather than getting wrapped up in what everyone else is doing and what they think they ‘should’ be doing, they stay true to themselves and what they want. It really is that simple.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152029/profile-JPG.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"f7646e66-f9a1-5627-b0b7-25126530a01a\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/top-three-things-confident-women-every-day.json\n// module id = 629\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"The BECCA Chrissy Teigen Palette Is Here And Now We Can All Look Like Her\",\"content\":\"<p>She&#8217;s a model, mum, cook book author, culinary wiz and, much to our endless delight, the owner of a razor sharp wit and glorious sense of humour.

It happens.<br />\\nLife. Like we said. Tricky. Take comfort in the fact that it’s the same for all of us. And then, make a commitment to treat yourself well. You know what that means. Eat healthily. <strong>Get at least eight hours of sleep every night</strong>. Work up a sweat often and spend time with the people you love.

An IV packed full of powerful vitamins to get you back on track.<br />\\nWord has it that Kim Kardashian hired a doctor to intravenously feed her a cocktail of B vitamins and anti-inflammatory medication to rejuvenate her hair and provide serious glow before attending the Met Gala. I figured if it was good enough for Kim, then it was good enough for me, so I booked in to see <strong>Katherine Millar Shannon</strong>, a Cosmetic Nurse Practitioner who has been administering IV-Vitamin Therapy at her <a href=\\\"http://duquessa.com.au\\\">Duquessa</a> clinics for near on four years.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2274\\\" style=\\\"width: 242px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2274\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01002541/me-JPG-242x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"242\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01002541/me-JPG-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01002541/me-JPG.jpg 477w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><strong>Editor Kelly Baker after an IV Vitamin infusion.

When that was out of the way I relaxed with a cosy blanket and chilled. Call me crazy, but I felt deeply at ease and even rejuvenated after the 60-minute session and I continued to feel better and better as the week progressed. <strong>I also received a bunch of compliments on my glowing skin</strong>. Coincidence? I think not.<br />\\nAnd according to Katherine, my results are not unusual. The vast majority of her clients report feeling energised and even experiencing glowing skin and shiny hair, not to mention a boost in mood. Nice one.<br />\\n“More and more of my clients are coming in showing serious signs of fatigue &#8211; which is apparent both physically and mentally,” explains Katherine.<br />\\n“Our IV Vitamin Therapy service is the treatment I’m recommending to remedy this and they have become increasingly popular for both men and women, delivering fast results and the boost which our clients desperately need.”<br />\\n<strong>By using an IV nutrients are delivered direct to the blood-stream</strong>, bypassing the digestive system. The IV-Vitamin Drip offers a more instant result than ingesting vitamins via diet, with cells absorbing up to 90 per cent of the rich nutrients on offer.<br />\\nTraditionally Vitamin C has been associated with fighting cold symptoms, so while it offers a kick to the immune system and a boost in energy, its benefits are as powerful on the outside as they are on the inside, says Katherine.<br />\\n“The power of Vitamin C on the skin is incredible. It helps to produce collagen, boosts skin cell rejuvenation and allows the skin to repair and hydrate,&#8221; says Katherine. And what can I say &#8230; it certainly seemed to be the case for me.</p>\\n<p><strong>The Duquessa Corporate IV Treatment Service is available in Sydney and Melbourne CBD and surrounds.

Still, it appears that is about to change.</p>\\n<p>Yes, the redheaded emoji is just a design at this stage and the final version is likely to look a little different.

Suddenly we could gift our loved ones (and ourselves) with<a href=\\\"https://www.damselfly.com.au/collections/xl-quote-candles\\\"> luxe candles</a> that smelled heavenly and also expressed exactly what we had on our minds.

Their creator, <strong>Christianna Heideman</strong>, is quite something too, which is why we asked her to hang with us for a bit and also, answer a few questions.</p>\\n<p><strong>A brief career synopsis if you would …</strong></p>\\n<p>After starting a fine arts degree fresh out of high school, I soon realised that I actually wanted to focus on creating my own brand rather than studying. At 19, I launched Damselfly, which was quickly picked up by major fashion boutiques and before long was stocked across the world. After a small hiatus working in design for some larger scale Australian fashion companies, I re-launched the label in 2013, but also entered into the homewares market, and we now create unique quote candles, jewellery, homewares &amp; cosmetics.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2090 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215917/JPG-270x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"270\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215917/JPG-270x300.jpg 270w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215917/JPG.jpg 396w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Now &#8230; where does your inspiration come from?</strong></p>\\n<p>Everywhere! I’m constantly absorbing inspiration from people, places, art, music, pop culture, fashion, travel, just to name a few&#8230; Anything can spark a design idea, or a new collection. I try to travel as much as my schedule allows, and it’s often visiting new cultures that can move my design focus to a whole new colour palette or style.</p>\\n<p><strong>How did the idea of quotes on candles come about?</strong></p>\\n<p>I’ve always loved candles and have been intrigued by the art of apothecary and could see there was a gap in the market for a candle that speaks to people and connects with the customer on another level. My vision was to create a product that made you laugh, or inspired you to get up and kick ass, as well as being luxe and beautiful to look at. The market was saturated with beautiful, girly, floral candles and I wanted to create something that was classic and feminine but that also hit you right in the face.<br />\\nThe first collection of quotes came straight from the heart and was basically a representation of my character in candle form. I had no idea how people would react to the random mermaid &amp; unicorn references, dry humour and dropping the F bomb in such a direct way… But it worked! I guess there are a lot of people out there like me with the same dry (slightly twisted..) sense of humour.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2088\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2088\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215753/12670766_10153499255113857_5562937021869476103_n.jpg 873w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Live the life you love.

Our customers have embraced the humour, and the point of difference we have created and really appreciate the idea of a traditional product being revamped.

Cons?</strong></p>\\n<p>I love social media, mainly because it allows me to connect directly with our customers, and engage in real time communication. It can be so inspiring to interact with other brands, and we have created some incredible collaborations from our social media platforms. Cons? I think we can all be guilty of wasting too much time on social media, and as a business owner and entrepreneur, I don’t have a lot of spare time! I try to cap the amount of time I spend in a ‘scroll hole’, and make sure that I switch off at the end of the day and focus on proper human interaction with my friends and family.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2087\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2087\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/24215702/17884609_10154507136723857_4592926596773316328_n.jpg 960w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The world is out there &#8211; waiting.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><strong>What are your plans for the future of Damselfly?</strong></p>\\n<p>We have so many exciting projects in the pipeline, and it feels like we are working on a million new product lines at the moment.

Nor do you need to opt for the one that your BFF is getting such great results with.</p>\\n<p>What you do need, however, is <strong>skincare products that are designed for YOU.</strong> And the easiest way to make that happen is to get a personal skincare recommendation from a skincare professional.</p>\\n<p>You can find one of those at your local dermatology office, your favourite skin clinic/salon where qualified therapists are employed, or at the counter of the department store or pharmacy line you favour.</p>\\n<p>Why go to the trouble of getting advice from a professional? Well, we&#8217;ll let <strong>Jenny Millar, Brand Manager for the line BABOR</strong> answer that one.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Firstly, a skincare professional assessment and thorough skin analysis,&#8221; says Jenny.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This will identify skin concerns and needs.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Which, says Jenny, may not be what you think they are. Apparently, it&#8217;s highly common for women to think they have a specific skin concern (say oiliness for example) <strong>when in fact the main issue is entirely different</strong> (perhaps rosacea).</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Often the cause of what they see as their problem is due to a different issue, hence the need to have this identified by a professional,&#8221; explains Jenny.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The scope of skincare needs is so varied and can often be a combination of concerns, like dehydration, oiliness, anti-ageing, acne, broken capillaries, loss of elasticity and the list goes on. When you are faced with varying concerns, a one-size-fits all approach is not suitable and you really need professional and bespoke support to generate results.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>There is also currently a <strong>trend for product customisation</strong>, with dual functionality being delivered &#8211; in layman&#8217;s terms, skincare products that do more than just one job.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;As women become more savvy they are demanding more customised, high performing products,&#8221; says Jenny.</p>\\n<p>Damn straight we are. So how to get those personalised skincare products that really will give us our best skin ever?</p>\\n<p>First step, a professional diagnosis, says Jenny.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;This will ensure that your customised <strong>regime and or products are best suited to you</strong>,&#8221; she confirms.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The process normally involves a thorough examination, a treatment and product prescription for at home use.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The best part about all of that? You will see results. Some clinics even offer sophisticated diagnostic and scanning equipment that confirm that with <strong>before and after pictures</strong> and who doesn&#8217;t love a little proof?</p>\\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s up to you where you get your skincare advice, tips and tricks. But our advice (and Jenny&#8217;s too) aim for someone who has a qualification in the field.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It’s always advised to visit a therapist that is reputable and has the professional knowledge and credentials to back up her claims,&#8221; says Jenny.</p>\\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s A Few We Made Earlier &#8230; Not Really.

Here, a few more fascinating insights into Anna and her honest-to-goodness inspirational life story.</p>\\n<p><strong>Firstly, a little history about you Anna &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>I grew up in <strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>. Once I finished college, I started my own event- planning business, which took up of most of my 20’s. I was doing the work that I chose and ticking all the right boxes, but at some point I began to feel restless. I began to question what I was working towards and what I was actually saving for? I’d always <strong>dreamed of travelling and living in Paris</strong> but for me the idea of actually doing it seemed overwhelming. A few more years went by and when I turned 30 and that’s when I decided enough was enough.

It doesn’t matter if you don’t speak the same language, or if you have nothing in common with them at all – there’s still that moment where you share the joy of this tiny little thing that’s just a bit out of the ordinary.

The Hammam at <a href=\\\"https://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71185/Grande-Mosquee-de-Paris\\\">The Mosquée de Paris </a>is my monthly ritual. Built in the 1920s not only is it beautiful but just so goddamn relaxing. If I’m not feeling good mentally may it be stress or I haven’t been sleeping well, I feel like it doesn’t matter how many layers I cake on, I still don’t like the way I look. The Hamman helps.</p>\\n<p>2. Indian sun treatment at <a href=\\\"http://www.franckprovost.com.au\\\">Frank Provost</a>. I love the look of having slightly sun kissed hair but living in Paris where the sun is not always shining makes it difficult to naturally create this look. Colour is applied by freehand painting and it works by lightening your natural colour making it very low maintenance.</p>\\n<p>3. <a href=\\\"http://haussmann.galerieslafayette.com/en/\\\">Galeries Lafayette</a> because it has EVERYTHING. I find myself popping in at least once a month. Sometimes I don&#8217;t have much time so I know I can get everything and anything I need whether it&#8217;s a manicure or beauty products.</p>\\n<p><strong>Your top three beauty tips &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>1.

I felt like a princess using a cotton pad embossed with the <strong>classic Chanel logo</strong>. I immersed the pad in toner and the moment it touched my skin I knew I’d never use anything else.

It was at a time that magazines were thriving and Cosmo was the biggest masthead there was. I got to travel, trail and interview. I got to work with smart young women. Wearing  a different waterproof mascara everyday and having a bucket of water thrown at my face, by way of a road-test, was actually part of my job.</p>\\n<p><strong>The best thing about being a beauty editor is/was …</strong><br />\\nWriting about beauty is really fun. At times it can be frivolous and at others, scientific. The industry itself is also very close-knit and supportive.

I have many. My folks are my best mates so most of my memories are pretty golden. I’d probably have to say endless summer days playing on our property with my siblings and my parents.

Their advice all pooled together, I’d have to say:<br />\\n<strong>Have a stash of your own cash somewhere for a ‘rainy day’. Be it literally under the mattress or a bank account, have 5-10 grand there incase you need it.

Share this with the sales assistant and ask them to select a few different fragrances, and then try two on the skin. Don’t rub or dab the perfume.</p>\\n<p>Let it unfold on the skin like a flower and be sure to have a good sniff every five minutes so you can smell the evolution of the fragrance as the different notes evaporate. This is called the dry down. <strong>Never, ever purchase a fragrance until it has been on your skin for at least 30 minutes.</strong> The base notes linger on the skin the longest, so you need to make sure that you love this part of the perfume as much as the top and middle notes.</p>\\n<p>Always try the fragrance on the skin. On the blotter (those white pieces of stiff paper the assistants spritz) it will be very linear, however once on your skin it will interact with your body’s natural chemistry and it will smell unique to you.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_1884\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1884\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27215338/Signorina-in-fiore-flacon-50ml-copy1-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27215338/Signorina-in-fiore-flacon-50ml-copy1-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27215338/Signorina-in-fiore-flacon-50ml-copy1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27215338/Signorina-in-fiore-flacon-50ml-copy1-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27215338/Signorina-in-fiore-flacon-50ml-copy1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><a href=\\\"http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10051&amp;productId=12134502&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;cm_mmc=googlesem-_-PLA-_-Health+and+Beauty+-+Personal+Care+-+Cosmetics+-+Perfume+and+Cologne-_-Salvatore+Ferragamo+Signorina+in+fiore+Eau+de+Toilette+100ml&amp;CAWELAID=620017140003667551&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;CAAGID=19211773216&amp;CATCI=pla-51320962143&amp;gclid=CJO67sTKxNMCFYiUvQod4_IMBw&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\\\">Salvatore Ferragamo Signorina in Fiore (100ml) EDT, $140. </a>A fruity floral fragrance.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the different between an EDT and an EDP and why should we care?</strong></p>\\n<p>Perfume is made from what we call juice or jus in French and alcohol. The juice is the perfume concentrate and is made from natural and synthetic raw materials. Alcohol is added to this to produce what we know as perfume. Eau de toilette has around 5-10 per cent juice and eau de parfum has 10-15 per cent and parfum has more than 15 per cent. The higher the concentration of juice the stronger the perfume and the longer it will last on the skin. You might wear an eau de toilette for the day and then an eau de parfum for the evening.</p>\\n<p><strong>Why are some fragrances so much more expensive than others?</strong></p>\\n<p>Niche fragrances tend to be more on the pricey side as they are created for a smaller, more discerning market. The ingredients used might be higher quality or rarer and the makers of the scent may manufacture in smaller runs. That doesn’t mean that commercial brands are not good quality &#8211; it just means that they are created for a broader appeal. I classify perfume brands into four different groups, niche, prestige, masstige and celebrity.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_1885\\\" style=\\\"width: 227px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1885\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220104/TENUE-DE-SOIREE-100ML-HD-227x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"227\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220104/TENUE-DE-SOIREE-100ML-HD-227x300.jpg 227w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220104/TENUE-DE-SOIREE-100ML-HD-768x1016.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220104/TENUE-DE-SOIREE-100ML-HD-774x1024.jpg 774w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><a href=\\\"http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/en/davidjones/tenue-de-soiree-edp-100ml\\\">Annick Goutal Tenue De Soiree (100ml) EDT, $242.</a> A modern day chypre.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Celebrity scents are very popular but some folk suggest they&#8217;re not quality perfumes. True?</strong></p>\\n<p>The actual process of creating a celebrity perfume is not that different to the other types of perfume. Contrary to popular belief, Kim Kardashian doesn’t actually make the fragrance her name is on. Instead, a highly trained perfumer creates the perfume.</p>\\n<p>However they would work with the celebrity to present a fragrance they like and feel fits their personal brand. They might have a lower budget for raw materials and need to move quickly to get their product on the market to capitalise on their popularity.</p>\\n<p><strong>How many perfumes should a woman own?</strong></p>\\n<p>How many shoes or hand bags should a woman own? You can never have too many. I have far more than 200 bottles and I still don’t have enough! I always tell my clients that they should think of perfume as a final accessory. Choose one to complement your outfit, the weather or how you are feeling. The very minimum is three. That&#8217;s one for day time, one for night time and one seduction perfume that brings out the inner seductress.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_1886\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1886\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220659/Angel-Eau-Sucree-2017-view-21-300x282.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"282\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220659/Angel-Eau-Sucree-2017-view-21-300x282.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220659/Angel-Eau-Sucree-2017-view-21-768x722.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27220659/Angel-Eau-Sucree-2017-view-21-1024x963.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><a href=\\\"https://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/angel-eau-sucree-edt-50ml-401817520\\\">Thierry Mugler Angel Eau Sucree EDT (50ml), $99.</a> Sexy, sweet and pretty damn seductive.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>On that &#8230; what&#8217;s the right type of scent for a date?</strong></p>\\n<p>Something intriguing, but not too heavy. Your fragrance should leave a tantalising sillage (trail of scent) that makes your date want to follow you anywhere …</p>\\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the best kind of fragrance for work?</strong></p>\\n<p>I call work fragrances polite perfumes. You want something that is subtle and doesn’t asphyxiate your co-workers. Fresh citrus, light florals or green scents work best in warm weather, and chypre or wood fragrances are ideal for colder weather. Keep your heavy florals and orientals for evening wear.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do we find a signature scent for ourselves?</strong></p>\\n<p>A signature scent should be the core of your fragrance wardrobe, something that you return to because it makes you feel good and is one that people comment on. It should sit well on your skin and last for at least a couple of hours. Think about what smells make you happy and share this with the sales assistant. Lots of people think that the perfect perfume is one you can’t smell on yourself.</p>\\n<p>This is so untrue! All that means is your nose has become accustomed to your perfume and has set it aside so it can do its job, which is to smell for danger in the environment around you and the food you are about to eat. If this is you, please don’t marinate yourself in your perfume, you might not be able to smell it, but we can!</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_1877\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1877\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27201816/ErosPF_EDT-100ml_bottle1-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27201816/ErosPF_EDT-100ml_bottle1-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27201816/ErosPF_EDT-100ml_bottle1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27201816/ErosPF_EDT-100ml_bottle1-768x766.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27201816/ErosPF_EDT-100ml_bottle1-1024x1021.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><a href=\\\"http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/en/davidjones/Eros-Pour-Femme-Eau-de-Parfum\\\">Versace Eros Pour Femme EDP (100ml), $165</a>.

Please, never in the bathroom, though there is no need to go as far as putting them in the fridge. The fridge is for wine.</p>\\n<p><strong>Does it have a use-by date?</strong></p>\\n<p>The general consensus is a couple of years, though if you store perfume correctly, you can make them last much longer. As long as you still like the way it smells, it is fine. Change in colour indicates that it may not be at its best, so if it smells a bit off, it’s time to throw your bottle away. This is a perfectly good reason to wear perfume all the time, don’t just save it for special occasions!</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_1894\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1894\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27223441/My-Burg-JPG-300x248.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"248\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27223441/My-Burg-JPG-300x248.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27223441/My-Burg-JPG.jpg 657w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.myer.com.au/shop/mystore/my-burberry-445571740-1\\\">Burberry My Burberry Black EDP (50ml), $150. </a>   A sensual floral that comes in a truly handsome flacon.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Why is perfume so important?</strong></p>\\n<p>I think perfume is a wonderful way to express yourself. It can enhance a facet of your personality, or even hide one. It can change the way you feel, and others around you. It can complement an outfit, cool you when you feel hot, and warm you when you feel cold, like a good whisky. It is an unspoken communication that tells a story, yours. Make it a good one.</p>\\n<p><b>And last of all, 2017 scents are going to be &#8230;</b></p>\\n<p>More independent brands are emerging, and the big brands are snapping them up as they are aware that the consumer is starting to look for something different in their perfumes. Once upon a time everyone wanted to smell like the latest release that all of their friends were wearing, now we are becoming more discerning and seeking brands with authenticity. I also feel that traditional styles of perfume such as soliflore and chypres are returning, we live in a turbulent world in 2017, we are seeking a little comfort in the familiar. Personalisation will also become more popular</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27222524/S-Taylor.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"0f8fc4eb-b659-5d22-9b59-186619f1bbc5\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/perfume-will-make-man-fall-madly-love.json\n// module id = 652\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"This Is Why You Need A Makeup Brush Collection\",\"content\":\"<p>Here at The Beauty Insider we like our beauty quick and easy.

But you know that right? Heck &#8211; every woman and her grandmother are using them.<br />\\nThe most popular are Korean-inspired sheet masks. If you’re a fan of Instagram you’ll already know this because you’ll have seen Hollywood stars and supermodels and regular beauty-loving folk like us posting selfies while sporting odd-looking masks of all kinds.<br />\\nSo here’s the deal. They look incredibly strange, but the truth is they’re incredibly beneficial &#8211; and not just for boosting your social media likes.<br />\\nYou see, this style of mask is soaked in skin-boosting ingredients. <strong>The idea is that you place the sheet mask on your face, lay back and let the ingredients absorb into your skin where they can do their thing.</strong><br />\\nThe benefit here is two-fold. For starters, quality masks will be infused with highly-efficacious ingredients that have the power to actively change your skin. There are masks right now that can ease sun spots, increase moisture levels, smooth and soften. And they can do so in just 10 to 15 minutes too. All you need to do is choose the right one for you.<br />\\nThe secondary benefit, sheet masks force you to take a moment to do nothing. And this is every bit as beneficial for your skin (and wellbeing) as the mask itself.<br />\\nWe recommend you try one today. Go on. Take 10 to 15 minutes for yourself.

I like applying a <strong>weekly conditioning treatment</strong>. For a mega-watt shine add a few drops of a tone-on-tone hair colour to the treatment (making sure it’s a colour match) and leave for 15 minutes. Rinse well and finish with a cool rinse.</p>\\n<p>Remember to slather on a <strong>daily body moisturiser</strong>  &#8211; a beauty step that is often forgotten. Focus on elbows, knees and feet.

We know you know this but we figure a reminder can&#8217;t hurt.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1552\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001815/ShhhSilk-170201-017-Front-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001815/ShhhSilk-170201-017-Front-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001815/ShhhSilk-170201-017-Front-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001815/ShhhSilk-170201-017-Front-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001815/ShhhSilk-170201-017-Front-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Sleep will come easier if you&#8217;re wearing this <a href=\\\"https://www.shhhsilk.com/products/pink-silk-shorties-pjs?variant=38137856975\\\">pink silk pyjama shortest set by Shhhsilk, $219.</a></em></p>\\n<p><strong>Eat a decent lunch</strong></p>\\n<p>We love this tip. According to Christine, French women always eat a hearty lunch so that they don&#8217;t overdo it of an evening. You see, a heavy meal late at night places stress on the digestive system, which can affect sleep.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The added bonus to eating a more substantial lunch is having fewer cravings for sweets or fatty snacks in the afternoon,&#8221; she adds. So you know, you get a French girl figure too. #winning.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1551\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001720/Peter-Alexander-3-205x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"205\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001720/Peter-Alexander-3-205x300.jpg 205w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001720/Peter-Alexander-3-768x1126.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14001720/Peter-Alexander-3-698x1024.jpg 698w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px\\\" />\\n<p>Or if you prefer your PJs less sexy and more cosy try this pair from Peter Alexander.

That&#8217;s public relations for those who don&#8217;t know &#8211; or perhaps care. The 36-year-old is the owner of the agency <a href=\\\"http://www.sweatybettypr.com\\\">Sweaty Betty</a> and also <a href=\\\"http://theministryoftalent.com/\\\">The Ministry of Talent</a> and she&#8217;s currently turning over many millions of dollars annually.</p>\\n<p>She&#8217;s often photographed out on the town in haute couture that sells for the average Australian&#8217;s monthly wage. She has several <a href=\\\"http://australia.hermes.com/birkin/au\\\">Hermes Birkin</a> hand bags &#8211; yes, the ones that cost somewhere in the vicinity of $200K.</p>\\n<p>Her every move is reported by the tabloids and it may be you feel you know her. But I&#8217;m here to tell you &#8211; you don&#8217;t. Because what you see in the papers and read online is not the real deal. The real Roxy is something far more impressive, way more interesting and infinitely more clever. More importantly, more generous and more kind.</p>\\n<p>See, you had her pegged wrong didn&#8217;t you? Because the thing is, kindness and generosity and a sweet nature don&#8217;t sell newspapers or get the clicks online. But if you want to get to know her, to see what&#8217;s she really like, read on. You&#8217;re in for a surprise &#8211; and something of a treat too.</p>\\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at how you started. How did you get into this industry?</strong></p>\\n<p>My first paid job was at McDonalds where I learnt the meaning of hard work. It instilled at me at a young age the importance of showing up and doing the best job you could, no matter what it was. I later moved into fashion and then started my own business 13 years ago. I saw an opportunity for PR to be done differently, not the typical mainstream way it had been done. Since then we have continued to provide our clients with campaigns that stand out and get their brands known.</p>\\n<p><strong>How or why do you think you&#8217;ve made such a success of it?</strong></p>\\n<p>I hustle and hustle hard! I want to get the best results for my client every time. I think that clients see how hard I work for their brands and businesses and the results that the Sweaty Betty team can deliver.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1466\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08181913/Roxy-J-pilates-271x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"271\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08181913/Roxy-J-pilates-271x300.jpg 271w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08181913/Roxy-J-pilates.jpg 533w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Working out is a significant part of Roxy&#8217;s life.

No secrets per se, but since having my<a href=\\\"http://honey.nine.com.au/2016/12/01/07/29/roxy-jacenko-says-cancer-could-return\\\"> cancer diagnosis</a> last year, I have made it a real focus to look after myself, eat well, exercise and also sleep – although I must admit, I love working so I probably don’t sleep as much as I should!</p>\\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you or is there no such thing?</strong></p>\\n<p>There really isn’t – at the office we are running around meeting with clients, arranging shoots, events – the list never ends. I think any business owner can attest to that there is no typical day, however, when I can I do love being in the office with the team and working on creating great events and campaigns, and attacking the never ending inbox!</p>\\n<p><strong>How on earth do you fit it all in?</strong></p>\\n<p>If you think about it too much you simply don’t. I try not to get too worried in the detail of how much I have on each day, week or month, but just getting my head stuck in and getting it done. It can easily get overwhelming if I was to think about it – just do it!</p>\\n<p><strong>What kind of mother are you?</strong></p>\\n<p>Being a mother is such an incredible job. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what type (certainly not a Tiger Mum ha!). I try and have fun with my kids, not necessarily be their best friend as I do need to get them to eat their vegies, but we all have a good laugh and do not take anything too seriously.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1467\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids-300x192.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"192\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids-300x192.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids-768x492.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids.jpg 928w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Nobody is more important to Roxy than her two children Pixie and Hunter.

Are you willing to tell us what you&#8217;ve had done and why?</strong></p>\\n<p>I like to keep you all guessing!!! I’ve probably not has as much as what people think, I have just had some to enhance my features, but I do also have a good skincare regime which does help as well.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you feel about your looks now as opposed to before?</strong></p>\\n<p>I’m really comfortable in who I am as a person, a mother, wife and daughter as well as business person. So whilst it’s great to look good, I’m fit healthy and that is probably finally showing which has made me more comfortable in my skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Anything you regret having done beauty and hair wise?</strong></p>\\n<p>I do get a good laugh looking back at old photos, but at the time, take some haircuts in the 90’s – that was very on trend! Maybe I go overboard here and there with fake tan, but I’d much prefer to use fake than bake and age my body prematurely.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1468\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG-300x191.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"191\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG-300x191.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG-768x488.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG.jpg 931w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><em>The PR queen has quite the bod. I mean hello! Image: Instagram/@roxyjacenko</em></p>\\n<p><strong>How do you feel on the whole about women being so judged by how they look?</strong></p>\\n<p>We can argue as much as we like about substance being more important, but whether we like it or not, we all judge on appearance. You don’t have to be a supermodel, but being well presented and taking pride in your appearance is important – I think this is true for men and women.</p>\\n<p><strong>What does it mean for you when sites such as the Daily Mail run stories EVERY day about EVERY single thing you do?</strong></p>\\n<p>I laugh a lot! If they are that interested in me going to the gym, having lunch with clients and running my business then good on them. But as they say, today’s paper is tomorrow’s fish and chip wrapping, so I really don’t get too caught up in it.</p>\\n<p><strong>Did you ever expect life would look like this?</strong></p>\\n<p>I’ve never had a plan or expectation of what life is, if you do I think you can be disappointed if it never meets your expectations. I’m really proud of the business I’ve built at Sweaty Betty and of my family, they are my proudest achievement.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1469\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG-300x191.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"191\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG-300x191.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG-768x490.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG.jpg 927w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Back in the gym where she gives it her all.

Multi-award-winning if we&#8217;re going to get into it.</p>\\n<p>And she has those awards because she&#8217;s phenomenal. The Sydney-based snapper, as they&#8217;re called in the trade, has something of the magical about her. It&#8217;s impossible to describe, but when she points and shoots she captures something that even her subjects may previously not have known existed.</p>\\n<p>She specialises in beauty photography and many of the images on this site, The Beauty Insider, belong to her. That&#8217;s unusual in this industry because beauty images do not come cheap. And Nicole could be charging us many thousands of dollars for each and every shot.</p>\\n<p>Instead she&#8217;s allowing us to run them without paying a cent. And we couldn&#8217;t be more grateful.</p>\\n<p>Why is she doing it? Firstly, because this is a start-up site and she&#8217;s the kind of woman who wants to see other women succeed and will do her best to make that happen.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, this is a site that aims to promote beauty in all its guises and that&#8217;s something Nicole has always believed in. She shoots women (and men, and kids, and pets) in an entirely different light from most beauty photographers and we mean that not in a literal, but a philosophical sense.</p>\\n<p>Yes, she works with the world&#8217;s most famous models &#8211; often &#8211; but Nicole also chooses to work with women outside the industry. Women she feels are are every bit as beautiful as those who grace the covers of mainstream fashion magazines. Possibly even more so.</p>\\n<p>Nicole sees genuine beauty everywhere. And she takes pictures of it. She shoots whatever and whoever takes her eye and also, what she feels the world most needs to see at the current time.</p>\\n<p>One of the most amazing shoots she has tackled in recent times was a beauty shoot in the mountains of Nepal. Here, Nicole cast for &#8216;models&#8217; amongst the local girls and women, many of whom arrived by push bike with little to no idea of what they were auditioning for.</p>\\n<p>But they audition they did.</p>\\n<p>And Nicole found the models she was dreaming of. Natural beauties who let their souls shine out through their shy, sweet smiles and open, honest gazes. There was no slick lighting. No international makeup artist. No assistants. No wind machine. And as the light began to fade, Nicole shot the images of a lifetime.</p>\\n<p>This is just one of them.</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s a perfectly still image of a local girl modelling jewellery which was hand-made in her village. She wears just a touch of makeup which Nicole applied herself and a pat of talcum powder to remove shine. And she&#8217;s heavenly.</p>\\n<p>Nicole was deeply moved by the young woman and the resulting images.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The light was fading and all I had was a back-up camera and a 50mm lens,&#8221; she says.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;And there was a moment when I felt such a responsibility &#8230; these girls had given me their trust and I didn&#8217;t want to let them down.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>And as you can see from even this one image she didn&#8217;t.</p>\\n<p>The shoot was a tremendous success and more importantly, life-changing for the women who gained status within their villages due to their involvement. For Nicole, nothing will ever be the same.</p>\\n<p>For while the glamour was missing, the heart was there and in abundance.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It was one of the greatest shoots of my life,&#8221; she says.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04220932/NEPAL20161020_5168.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"beauty-talk\",\"name\":\"Beauty Talk\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"be8b203d-0bc9-5eca-b33b-125518150189\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/redefining-beauty.json\n// module id = 673\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Delicious cocktails that won&#8217;t blow your diet\",\"content\":\"<p>Party season is almost over.

I couldn’t believe it. The rigorous training I got there, plus being surrounded by oodles of style has made me the journalist and now author I am today.</p>\\n<p><strong>How long have you worked in the industry?</strong><br />\\nFor over 30 years. Do not do the maths!</p>\\n<p><strong>What would surprise us about working in the industry? Well, not me, because I work in it too, but you know, the folk who don&#8217;t?</strong><br />\\nI think people would be surprised by what a supportive industry it is. I have made and continue to make lifelong friends. We are always helping each other out with advice and information and giving constructive feedback. I found this especially when I was writing <strong>Secrets of a Beauty Queen</strong>. The input and support I had from the beauty posse was incredible.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1387\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104354/md1008Stephanie011-1-200x300.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104354/md1008Stephanie011-1-200x300.png 200w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104354/md1008Stephanie011-1-768x1151.png 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104354/md1008Stephanie011-1-683x1024.png 683w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104354/md1008Stephanie011-1.png 854w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Yes &#8230; she looks like this.

Just kidding. My column in Sunday Life has a road test element so I am now up to 179 road tests all of them different. This means I get to test drive all sorts of fabulous and sometimes painful procedures, including getting my nails done.</p>\\n<p><strong>What is the beauty tip you wish with all your being that the rest of us knew about? Again not me because I know everything &#8211; obvs.</strong><br />\\nHow important it is to wear SPF50+ sunscreen every day of your life on your face, décolletage (remember people &#8211; your face ends at your boobs) and on the backs of your hands. You need to do this if you don’t want to end up looking 15 years older than you actually are.</p>\\n<p><strong>What is the beauty tip you use regularly that you still find completely surprising?</strong><br />\\nWhen I apply khol to the inner rim of my lower lid. I really should do this every day as it is completely rock star. I love black but have also experimented with violet and red!</p>\\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your daily skincare regime look like? Don&#8217;t lie! Remember we know you!</strong><br />\\nOk so I am on a new Rationale regime with a cleanser, eye cream, niacinamide serum, antioxidant serum, day cream and SPF 50+ in the morning and at night: cleanser, night cream and retin A serum.</p>\\n<p><strong>Give us a brief list of the treatments you&#8217;ve had and loved &#8230;</strong><br />\\nThe treatments I love are often the simple tactile ones: I always love a manicure and pedicure as well as a blow dry.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1388\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104407/SecretsofaBeautyQueen_cover-211x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"211\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104407/SecretsofaBeautyQueen_cover-211x300.jpg 211w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104407/SecretsofaBeautyQueen_cover-768x1092.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04104407/SecretsofaBeautyQueen_cover-720x1024.jpg 720w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Secrets of a Beauty Queen by Stephanie Darling.

Personally I think some of those heat treatments are pretty ouchy!</strong><br />\\nI have never loathed a treatment (because you know what they say no pain no gain) but some have been on the ouchy side. My first ultherapy treatment made my eyes water – a lot.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you feel about non-surgical procedures such as muscle freezing injections and fillers? And yes &#8211; that&#8217;s a big old Botox needle bruise you can see on my face right now.</strong><br />\\nI think fillers and toxins, when delivered by an expert with a real understanding of how faces work, are genius. The big freeze is a thing of the past when administered with care and caution. For the over 50s the big news is that the revised facelift is back on the front burner.</p>\\n<p><strong>Australian women are known for their beauty &#8211; why do you think that is?</strong><br />\\nI think the relaxed beauty that Australian women embrace is the key – even if it has taken two hours to look that effortless.</p>\\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m busy and poor. I&#8217;m kind of using that as an example but it&#8217;s totally true. Bummer. What do you recommend I do in terms of A) Skincare and B) Makeup &#8230;</strong><br />\\nI think beauty supermarkets like Priceline are the best places to experiment with good affordable skin care and beauty products. You can ask advice but then take it at your own pace. And remember SPF 50+ at all times.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do you feel about facials? If you can, recommend one to me.</strong><br />\\nI think facials are about the feel good factor as well as results. Extractions for me are key in any facial treatment.</p>\\n<p><strong>Brow tattooing or no brow tattooing?</strong><br />\\nFor those of use with pale or sparse brows, expertly administered brow tattooing is a lifesaver.</p>\\n<p><strong>Simplest way to revamp my look?</strong><br />\\nChange up your lipstick colour. If you wear nudes embrace red.</p>\\n<p><strong>Best hair tip EVER?</strong><br />\\nGet a blowdry.</p>\\n<p><strong>Number one way to take off 10 years?</strong><br />\\nHave a facelift.</p>\\n<p><strong>Do we have to spend up big if we want results?</strong><br />\\nYou kinda do except if you have been good and worn sunscreen your whole life.</p>\\n<p><strong>And on that, all-time favourite skincare product is</strong> &#8230;Ultraceuticals MD SPF 50+ sunscreen</p>\\n<p><strong>And makeup product is</strong> &#8230;<br />\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.shiseido.com.au/products/Makeup/Advanced_Hydro-Liquid_Compact/295/\\\">Shiseido Hydrop Liquid Compact.</a></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1397\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105413/Shiseido-HLC-300x195.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"195\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105413/Shiseido-HLC-300x195.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105413/Shiseido-HLC.jpg 493w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Nail product?</strong><br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.opi.net.au\\\">O.P.I Nail Polish in Lincoln Park After Dark</a>.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1396\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105403/OPU-Lincoln-Park-After-Dark-177x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"177\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105403/OPU-Lincoln-Park-After-Dark-177x300.jpg 177w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105403/OPU-Lincoln-Park-After-Dark.jpg 261w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Hair?</strong><br />\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.tangle-teezer.com.au\\\">Tangle Teezer</a>.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1395\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105350/tangle-teezer-254x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"254\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105350/tangle-teezer-254x300.jpg 254w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/04105350/tangle-teezer.jpg 301w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\\\" />\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Why thank you Mrs Darling and see you for champagne and laughter very soon.</p>\\n<p>Lots of beauty love,</p>\\n<p><strong>The Beauty Insider.

Right now we can&#8217;t think of any though so um &#8230; get back to us on that. The chilly season can suck for a bunch of reasons too &#8211; and we know all about those.</p>\\n<p>It wreaks havoc on skin and it&#8217;s not polite to nails either. But it&#8217;s okay. Better even. Because Tracey Winder, <strong>nail genius and trainer at Mavala</strong> can fix your nails in a flash. We asked her how and this is what she told us. Frankly, our fingertips have never looked prettier.</p>\\n<p><strong>Firstly, what effect does winter have on hands and nails?</strong><br />\\nNail growth slows down during the winter months when a drop in temperatures coincides with a reduction in circulation. Blood flow to the matrix (the root of the nail) is compromised, the engine room for the healthy production and growth of nail tissue.<strong> As environmental conditions change with less moisture in the air</strong>, nails are affected just as the skin is and the nail plates become more dehydrated. Not to mention, switching between temperature extremes of warm heating indoors and cool condition outdoors.</p>\\n<p><strong>What are the symptoms with hands and nails?</strong><br />\\nSkin on the hands is susceptible to becoming red, dry and chapped as the moisture barrier is compromised during winter. Nail condition is weakened, so you will likely notice <strong>nails becoming dryer, being more brittle,</strong> softer or even peeling. Cracked, dry cuticles are often a result of a change in weather, which not only look unsightly but can be painful too! All of these conditions affect what your manicure looks like and how long it lasts.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1295\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213246/270-Firenze-149x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"149\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213246/270-Firenze-149x300.jpg 149w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213246/270-Firenze-768x1544.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213246/270-Firenze-509x1024.jpg 509w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213246/270-Firenze.jpg 800w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px\\\" /> <img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1296\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213305/266-Singapore-149x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"149\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213305/266-Singapore-149x300.jpg 149w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213305/266-Singapore-768x1544.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213305/266-Singapore-509x1024.jpg 509w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213305/266-Singapore.jpg 800w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px\\\" /> <img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1297\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213324/237-Basel-149x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"149\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213324/237-Basel-149x300.jpg 149w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213324/237-Basel-768x1544.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213324/237-Basel-509x1024.jpg 509w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27213324/237-Basel.jpg 800w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Looking for a quality polish that&#8217;s super pretty and protects nails too? Try <a href=\\\"http://mavala.com.au\\\">Mavala Nail Polish</a> in Firenze, Singapore or Basel.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>What special care is required during this time of year?</strong><br />\\nLike with your skin, this is the time of year to be introducing some additional steps into your hand and nail care routine to compensate for the winter aggressors. <strong>A little bit of TLC with your nails will go a long way</strong> in protecting your manicure! Your hands and nails need to be ‘nursed’ back to health, so be sure to apply specific rich, nutritive treatment products. Always protect the nails with a coat of polish that is good for the nails, i.e. a product that contains ingredients that wont compromise the health of the nail (so at a minimum 5-free) and will allow the nail to breathe. This doesn’t always have to be colour, even a natural clear top or base coat will protect during winter.</p>\\n<p><strong>Any other tips for protecting nails during winter?</strong><br />\\nKeep your nails shorter during winter, with regular filing. Always use a gentle, acetone-free remover, which is much less drying on the nail. <strong>Take care to wear gloves while using water and detergent.</strong> Drink lots of water to compensate for the extra dehydration and ensure your diet is rich in vitamins (A,B,C,D and E) and minerals (calcium, iron, silicium) to ‘feed’ healthy nail growth. Nail-loving supplements are also an option during winter months.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-566\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155531/brilliant-strength-nail-enamel-651851-136x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"136\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155531/brilliant-strength-nail-enamel-651851-136x300.jpg 136w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155531/brilliant-strength-nail-enamel-651851-768x1694.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155531/brilliant-strength-nail-enamel-651851-464x1024.jpg 464w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 136px) 100vw, 136px\\\" /><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-575\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155955/Sally-Hansen3D-Gel-Shine-21-141x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"141\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155955/Sally-Hansen3D-Gel-Shine-21-141x300.jpg 141w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155955/Sally-Hansen3D-Gel-Shine-21-480x1024.jpg 480w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155955/Sally-Hansen3D-Gel-Shine-21.jpg 571w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px\\\" /><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-563\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155345/CrystalNailFile1-300x163.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"163\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155345/CrystalNailFile1-300x163.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155345/CrystalNailFile1-768x418.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13155345/CrystalNailFile1-1024x558.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><em>Try a protective product such as <a href=\\\"http://revlonanz.com\\\">Revlon Brilliant Strength</a> or <a href=\\\"http://ausallyhansen.com\\\">Sally Hansen Gel Shine 3D Top Coat </a>and always use a quality nail file such as this crystal version by <a href=\\\"http://modelcocosmetics.com\\\">ModelCo</a> Crystal Nail and in one direction only please.

Seriously. I don’t want to insult you or make you feel badly (really, I don’t) but I have to get this off my chest. I don’t believe it’s truly necessary for you to apply a full face of makeup here &#8211; on the train, or the bus or tram &#8211; <strong>heck, even the ferry</strong>.<br />\\nMy feeling is that with a slight rejigging of your schedule, which I’ve no doubt is ridiculously hectic &#8211; I mean whose isn’t these days &#8211; that you could find the five to 10 minutes you need to apply truly flattering, perfectly pretty makeup.<br />\\nAnd I wish you would.<br />\\nNot because it offends me to see you hard at work transforming yourself but because I fear that you’re missing the point.<strong> And that is that makeup is a joy.</strong> Or at least it should be. But I do not believe it can be if you’re applying it while hurtling through the suburbs on the public transport of your choice.<br />\\nPublic transport, with its over-crowding and enforced intimacy is not an appropriate setting for blending your blush. Nor lining the inner rim of your eyes. Or blotting your lipstick. All of these are acts that should take place somewhere with a flattering soft light, a sense of calm and on a purely practical note, a kick-ass mirror.<br />\\nFor starters <strong>you’d get better results &#8211; no doubt</strong>. Also, you could move your arms freely, stretch and wriggle with abandon, stop and start and admire your results as you progressed. And you needn’t feel the slightest bit self conscious or awkward. And this, I believe, is what you’re missing if you’re doing your makeup in the midst of carriage 303. Pleasure. Like I said earlier, I believe that’s what makeup is all about.<br />\\nYes, the idea behind it is that it will make you look more beautiful, but more importantly, cleverly-applied makeup will <strong>makeup will make you feel more beautiful</strong>. It’s not meant to be something you have to do before you go out into the world, drop your kids at school, hit the office and so on. It’s not meant to make you more acceptable or appropriate &#8211; bare skinned you is just perfect.<br />\\nNo, in my book, makeup (think a light foundation that gives a dewy finish, blush that provides a flattering ‘I just strolled through the countryside’ vibe, a lovely rosy lip), <strong>is about boosting your mood</strong>. It’s about looking into your eyes in a mirror (a full-sized one &#8211; not the flip top of an eyeshadow palette) and recognising the beauty there. It’s about performing a ritual of sorts, one that sees you treating yourself with a little love and kindness. It’s about taking one last look and admiring what you see, allowing yourself to feel good about who you are and your place in the world.<br />\\nYes, it’s only makeup. But if you apply it in the right way, which is with some quiet care and a whole lot of self love, it has the capacity to <strong>start your day on a positive note</strong>. And if you ask me that simply cannot happen on the city express.</p>\\n<p>Love,</p>\\n<p>The Beauty Insider.</p>\\n<p>PS: <strong>If you absolutely must do your makeup on public transport here’s a tip or two to make the experience that little bit easier &#8211; for you and the rest of us.</strong></p>\\n<p>Consider tinting your lashes or even <strong>having lash extensions applied</strong>. That way you can skip the mascara at the very least.</p>\\n<p>An oversized crayon style lipstick will be considerably easier to apply than a traditional lipstick.

This is your face after all.</p>\\n<p>So, let&#8217;s look at muscle freezing injections such as <strong>Botox and Dysport</strong> first of all. We&#8217;ve tried both and had excellent results. But this industry has changed an awful lot in recent years and continues to do so. Given that, we figured a quick update couldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>\\n<p>Take it away <strong>Charlie Abboud</strong>, Head of Injectables at<a href=\\\"http://www.laserclinics.com.au\\\"> Laser Clinics Australia</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>What are the most attractive aspects of Cosmetic Injectables?</strong></p>\\n<p>Non invasive, quick and easy treatments,<br />\\nLong lasting results,<br />\\nConvenient and affordable,<br />\\nAnd treatments are tailored to suit client&#8217;s needs</p>\\n<p><strong>How do they work?</strong></p>\\n<p>Anti-wrinkle injections are made from a <strong>purified protein that causes facial muscles to relax,</strong> softening lines and reducing the severity of visible wrinkles. This decrease of movement in the muscle creates less stress on the skin, helping to maintain a fresh, youthful and rejuvenated appearance.<br />\\nThe injections actively prevent the formation of static wrinkles (deeper lines and folds caused by repeated movement over time).</p>\\n<p><strong>What is new in the field?</strong></p>\\n<p>Results are no longer so &#8216;fake looking&#8217;. Not that long ago it was the perception that you would walk in and then walk out<strong> looking very overdone and frozen</strong>. Techniques, training and products can now deliver results ranging from glamorous, to more subtle &#8211; depending on a client&#8217;s needs. Some clients do not want anyone to know they have had cosmetic injections &#8211; they want to look naturally refreshed and youthful, without and obvious change. We can achieve that.</p>\\n<p><strong>What areas can be treated?</strong></p>\\n<p>Anti-wrinkle injections start to work <strong>two to three days after the injection</strong> and reach their full effect within seven to 14 days. The effects can typically last for up to three to four months depending on the individual.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cost please &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Prices vary depending on where you have your treatment carried out and how many units of product you use. At <a href=\\\"http://www.laserclinics.com.au\\\">Laser Clinics Australia</a> prices start from $99 per area or $3.95 per unit.

Each client has their own suite, so we offer the utmost privacy. Long haul hairdressing involving colour requires a client to spend a fair amount of time at the salon. We try to make this time as pleasurable as possible.<br />\\nI am also not aligned to any one hair care brand. We choose the best products and colours from every range. I like the reds from one, the blondes from another.<br />\\nOur salon was one of the first colour specialist salons in the country. We offer meticulous colouring techniques. I try to make my blondes as natural and seamless as possible. I am known for my blonde techniques and we have a V.I.P room appropriately named <strong>The Blonde Room</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Added Extras:</strong><br />\\nMy mother is a wonderful cook and makes many delicious <strong>Greek cakes and treats</strong>. Our clients love them.  Some even call to see what&#8217;s on the menu before they arrive. I believe that when it comes to making a hair statement for a special occasion there is nothing quite like a hair accessory. I have designed a range of head bands and hair accessories.<br />\\nI am also a bit of a<strong> beauty junkie</strong> so I am always on the look out from fabulous cult products for my clients. I was the first to bring Tarte and Eve Lom to Australia.</p>\\n<p><strong>Hot Hair Tip for the Season:</strong><br />\\nLonger hair is definitely making a comeback. The emphasis is on gloss and shine so hair needs to be really healthy.

Yes you can. Really. Laura says so and life coaches don&#8217;t lie. Images: Lucas Dawson for Myer.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>I worry I don’t do my hair and makeup right … To that you say?</strong></p>\\n<p>&#8220;What is your definition of ‘right’? ‘Right’ according to whom? It sounds like you may be creating standards for yourself based on what you think others think, however we will never actually have any way of knowing what is truly going through their minds. Therefore, you will find yourself constantly <strong>striving for an ideal that quite possibly doesn’t exist</strong>, and so consequently you are likely to continually feel like a failure because you will never be able to achieve this magical ideal as it is unachievable.</p>\\n<p>As a result it is probable that your self-confidence and self-worth will take a knock, so you worry even more about how you look, and thus you enter into a perpetual cycle of never feeling good enough and beating yourself up for it. What you could do instead is remember to focus on the things you can control and let go of the things you can’t. You most certainly <strong>cannot control other peoples’ thoughts</strong> but what you can control is what you think about yourself and what you want your hair and make-up to look like.</p>\\n<p>If you feel good, that’s all that matters and stuff what anyone else thinks. Self-confidence is actually the thing that will make you sexy, the hair and make-up is just the pretty bow on top.</p>\\n<p><strong>I would love to cruise the beauty department counters but I get nervous. Advice?</strong></p>\\n<p>&#8220;Firstly check in with yourself and ask what it is about cruising the beauty department counters that makes you nervous. Be prepared to dig deep here and be really honest with yourself. I suspect it’s similar to the problem above and <strong>you’re worried about what others think</strong>. As I said before, you will never be able to control others’ thoughts so rather than trying to and getting hung up on it, focus on what it is that you want and just enjoy the experience.</p>\\n<p>A big part of the problem here is the act of judgement – my guess would be that you’re intimidated by the beauty girls because they are all immaculately made up and so you sub-consciously think that they must be better than you in some way. On the flip side, you think they are judging you because your hair and make-up is not at a similar level to theirs.</p>\\n<p>This is judgement at its best. You actually know nothing about these women and they know nothing about you, so <strong>why not view and treat them just like anyone else</strong> and get curious about how they can help you, that is after all what they’re there for.&#8221;</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15222739/Myer-photos-by-Lucas-Dawson-2.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"5c899764-aa84-5e62-9d2d-c4b9ae40e04c\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/boost-beauty-confidence.json\n// module id = 681\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"The beauty of self belief\",\"content\":\"<p><strong>Cat was on the brink of suicide.</strong> The young photographer could no longer carry on pretending everything was okay in her world.</p>\\n<p>Despite her many successes, she knew deep down she was living a lie and always had been. Cat was a man trapped in a woman&#8217;s body. Thankfully, Cat made the brave decision to stay with us and instead, undergo gender reassignment surgery.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cat is now Scott. This is his story.</strong></p>\\n<p>&#8220;From a very young age my family, teachers and friends bandied around the same phrase. “She’s just a tomboy, she’ll grow out of it,&#8221; they would say. By the time I was four it had become a mantra of sorts for them.</p>\\n<p>The first time I felt truly uncomfortable about that would have been when I was maybe seven years old. I had finished a swimming lesson and I was leaving the pool complex with some boys. We were all wearing shorts, no T-shirts.  I vividly remember my mother running at me with a towel trying to cover my chest; she was horrified. I was extremely upset. I was hurt and confused, but once I saw how upset my mother was, I complied.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bathrooms were the worst.</strong> From the age of five I’ve had issues with them. When I was in primary school, I tried not to use the school toilets at all. Even when I was Head Girl, the younger students kept reporting me to teachers for being in the wrong toilets. School uniforms were also awful for me. My parents were prepared to fork out the money for me to attend a private school but I point blank refused on the grounds that I would have had to have worn a skirt, something they failed to understand. That was tough.</p>\\n<p>Shopping for clothes used to terrify me (even as an adult). Any situation involving gender-specific clothing was awful.  I hated wearing women’s clothes.  The number of times I was asked if I was<strong> ‘buying clothes for my boyfriend’</strong> or if I was lost while trying to find clothes for work &#8230; I&#8217;ve lost count.</p>\\n<p>A great number of people made judgements on me based on my appearance. Most people thought I was a lesbian.</p>\\n<p>That part never really struck me until I came out to my sister as transgender.  Unbeknownst to me, she had spent her entire life from about the age of 13 defending me from all sorts of accusations about my character and sexuality. I never really understood how difficult it was for her; she is fiercely protective of me. <strong> In her eyes, she’s always had an older brother</strong>.  Once I came out, the questions ended.  There was no ambiguity anymore; it was just a case of people saying: “Oh of course &#8211; that makes perfect sense.”</p>\\n<p>The people around you do make you feel ‘different.’  I’ve been extremely fortunate in the sense that my family have never tried to feminise me or force me to be anyone I’m not; they’ve always accepted me for who I am.  That said, my parents are honest, working class people.  I was a lot more than they ever anticipated having to deal with.</p>\\n<p><strong>I have always felt like a terrible disappointment</strong>. No amount of personal or professional success has ever assuaged that. I have always felt like an embarrassment to my family; that drove me to succeed in a number of fields.</p>\\n<p>If anything I was guilty of over-committing to everything I did to compensate. I know now that I was torturing myself. But when you fail to see any value in yourself, it’s impossible to understand that anyone else could see something.</p>\\n<p>I don’t blame my parents at all though; there were no positive role models in the transgender community at all up until recently. The thing that stopped me (considering gender reassignment surgery) was the thought that I’d become a bigger freak, a bigger embarrassment.  The first time I looked into it was when I was in my early 20’s.  I constantly talked myself out of it for the above mentioned reasons.  <strong>I was always terrified that no one would love me if I went through with it</strong>. I had to reach a point in life where I knew that things would never be worse.</p>\\n<p>In late 2014 I felt trapped. I didn&#8217;t leave the house for three months.I was a mess, I couldn’t see any future at all. I was living a lie and felt there was nothing left for me anywhere. I took a significant payout, I drank most of it away.  For me, it was the end.</p>\\n<p>But then my best mate dragged me out for lunch and gave me a job consulting for him; without his intervention we wouldn’t be having this conversation.  From that point I began to reassess my life. <strong>Having considered transitioning for the previous 10+ years, it was do this or check out</strong>. I didn’t have the energy to pretend anymore.</p>\\n<p>I feared losing everything. But as I said, I had already lost it all, so in that sense the argument was redundant.  For me, this was the first time in my life that I felt like I was actually taking charge of things.</p>\\n<p>By and large, everyone was outstanding (about the surgery).</p>\\n<p>My family were exceptional. They’ve only ever wanted me to be happy and I never was.  They lost their miserable, volatile daughter/sister and gained an outgoing, stable, successful son and brother.  Initially my mother was very caught up in <strong>&#8216;what the neighbours would think&#8217;</strong>, but all of the traits and behaviours that made me a difficult woman made me a good man.</p>\\n<p>She’s never been prouder of me and our relationship has never been better.  My father also struggled to relate to me, now it’s as if we can all exhale and just be. My sister has been my rock.  She’s supported me through everything.</p>\\n<p>I think the fact that I was finally taking responsibility for my life and happiness was the biggest positive for them.  I’ve always been the tortured genius and my own worst critic.  One of my biggest flaws previously was taking the people who care about me for granted.  Not only did this process strip whatever ego I had, <strong>it showed me the value of the people who love me</strong>.</p>\\n<p>My employers were outstanding, I work for a family run-company and everyone there has supported me unconditionally.</p>\\n<p>Some of my friends struggled a little initially. For the vast majority it was a very easy transition.  <strong>My closest friend took it fairly hard, but he was honest.</strong>  He told me at the beginning that he respected me and understood, but needed time to learn to accept it.  Beyond pleasantries, I didn’t speak to him for almost nine months.  Between the hormones and self-absorption, I didn’t notice it initially, but once I did it was utterly devastating.  I felt like I’d lost him.  I appreciate him so much more now, and I value every second I get to spend with him. Our relationship today is stronger than ever.</p>\\n<p>The person I see in the mirror today is starting to reflect who I am on the inside. Every day I get a little bit closer. <strong> I’ve got a dodgy sort of beard now and about four chest hairs</strong>.  But one of the biggest lessons I have gleaned from this process is that the things I aspire to be can’t be seen in a mirror.</p>\\n<p>I aspire to be a great man; a man my family, friends and colleagues are proud of.  <strong>That’s something you can’t see in the mirror.</strong></p>\\n<p>As told to photographer Nicole McCluskey.

If you have a great haircut then you’re halfway there &#8211; you need a great shape as a starting point. The second most important is great products. You don’t need to fuss with stylers and curlers if you have quality products.</p>\\n<p>Or try a braid &#8211; they’re so on trend right now or even a sleek ponytail with a bit of body.</p>\\n<p><strong>My hair is dry and flat. What I want is silky smooth and glossy …</strong></p>\\n<p>Start by using a protector spray if you’re using a flat iron or styler. Use a mask weekly and also ask your stylist about an intensive moisture treatment next time you’re in the salon.</p>\\n<p><strong>I want long hair! But it doesn&#8217;t seem to want to grow past my shoulders &#8230; Am I imagining things? How do I make it happen?</strong></p>\\n<p>Make sure you trim, even if it’s every three months to ensure you’re cutting the ends off. Make sure you take care of it and be patient! You need to be patient to go through the whole hair growth cycle and for some people that just takes a long time.</p>\\n<p><strong>Short hair is less work &#8211; true or false? And why?</strong></p>\\n<p>Totally false! Short hair is really unforgiving. When it grows, the cut loses it’s shape much quicker than most of the longer styles. If you’ve got long hair you can chuck it up in a ponytail or put a cute braid in or throw it in a bun. When you’re a short haired girl you don’t have those options. If you’ve got short hair, the key to keeping it looking great all the time is getting it styled on time.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do I know what style will really suit me?</strong></p>\\n<p>Consulting with a professional is really helpful, however you also need to be honest. You’re not going to look like Kim Kardashian without a lot of money and a lot of plastic surgery. We have to be realistic about our expectations. If you have baby, fine hair, you can’t look at a picture and expect to have thick, voluminous hair &#8211; that’s just not your hair type. So it’s being honest, consulting a professional and also being honest about the work you want to put into it. We can all have pretty fabulous hair we spend the time and effort that required.

So here’s a sneaky guide to identifying your skin type today &#8211; read it to ID which type you are. Then, you can be 100 per cent confident you’re choosing the products and treatments that suit you best.</p>\\n<p><strong>Oily Skin</strong></p>\\n<p>Skin is affected by genes and your hormones too. This means it can change at various periods of your life &#8211; think puberty and menopause for example. Still, if for the majority of the time your skin general appears shiny and has enlarged pores, occasionally develops blackheads and whiteheads too, plus an odd pimple or even acne, you’re likely to be an oily type.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Try moisturisers and also makeup that have mattifying ingredients to tone down shine.</p>\\n<p><strong>Normal Skin</strong></p>\\n<p>No enlarged pores are visible and on the whole, you’ve got a nice little glow going on.</p>\\n<p>Your skin is smooth, plump looking, has few to no blackheads (or whiteheads either) and pimples are rare. You’re normal.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Your skin is gorgeous. Keep it that way by wearing an SPF all year round.</p>\\n<p><strong>Combination Skin</strong></p>\\n<p>This type is particularly common and easy to recognise. If your T-zone (the forehead, nose and areas around the mouth and chin) appear shiny then you have combination skin, says Charlotte Turner.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Use oily skin products in the T-zone but opt for normal elsewhere.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dry Skin</strong></p>\\n<p>Can feel tight and touchy and even rough to the touch. Often looks dry or slightly flaky and is prone to fine lines and ageing. Breakouts are very rare but conditions such as dermatitis and even eczema are common.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Take shorter showers, use mild, gentle cleansers and apply a rich moisturiser as needed.<br />\\n<em>Clarins Cleansing Milk with Alpine Herbs for Dry/Normal Skin, $44. clarins.com or 02 9663 4277.</em></p>\\n<p>Removes dirt and grime yet add moisture and neutralises the drying effect of water.</p>\\n<p><em>Giorgio Armani ARMANI PRIMA Glow-On Moisturising Balm, $128. 1300 651 991</em>.</p>\\n<p>Hydrates even the driest skin leaving it radiant and dewy, plus it’s a perfect pre-foundation base.</p>\\n<p><em>Homedics Radiance Microdermabrasion Device, $249. homedics.com.au or 03 8756 6512.</em></p>\\n<p>A handheld microdermabrasion device that whips off dead skin cells and stimulates the skin beneath.

Lotions and creams, gels and powders, brushes, lipsticks, eyeshadows and more.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, however, the items that should be in the cabinet are frequently nowhere to be found. Here, a <strong>Beauty Editor’s</strong> list of the products you never knew you needed.</p>\\n<p><strong>Primer</strong></p>\\n<p>Primers burst onto the scene roughly 10 years ago leaving your average woman utterly baffled. But these products are not just simple to use, they’re game changers.</p>\\n<p>Think of it like this &#8230; when you paint a wall you don’t just slap on a coat on a paint. No, you prep first and then apply an undercoat (hello primer).</p>\\n<p>Same goes for applying foundation. If you want it to go on easy and not settle into any fine lines or tiny flaws, then you need to first apply primer. This will give a smooth base and also, provide your foundation with something to group meaning it will last longer.</p>\\n<p><strong>Brow Mascara</strong></p>\\n<p>A mascara style brow brush is a must-have. Here’s a tip though. Make sure it’s in a shade that suits your natural hair colour. To get the full effect, apply at the root of the brow using a gentle back and forth motion rather than just brushing across the top.</p>\\n<p>Add a clear mascara style brow product afterwards to keep hair in place if needed.</p>\\n<p><strong>Eyelash Curler</strong></p>\\n<p>There are some very clever mascaras on the market right now. They curl, separate, add thickness and length. But nothing (and I mean NOTHING) transforms lashes like a quality curler does. Keep one handy and curl seconds before you apply your mascara. Start at the base of your lashes and squeeze the curler tight. Repeat mid lash. Then, apply your mascara for knock-out, doe-eyed sexiness.</p>\\n<p><strong>Moisturiser with SPF</strong></p>\\n<p>We all know that we need to wear sunscreen 365 days a year and yet, so many of us don’t. But skipping sunscreen is a huge risk. It may mean premature signs of ageing such as fine lines, sagging and worse, skin cancer. Plus, all those anti-ageing creams and treatments you invest in are effectively rendered useless if you don’t wear sunscreen.</p>\\n<p>Ensure you’re covered by combining your moisturiser and sun protection in one.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cheek and Lip Crayon</strong></p>\\n<p>You’ve no doubt seen these thick, crayon-style lip pencils that can be used to add just a hint of colour to the lips, or layered for a more impressive pout. They’re a blend of lipstick and lip balm, meaning they feel soft and soothing on the mouth yet provide awesome colour.</p>\\n<p>They can also be used on the cheeks for a natural, flush. Better still, they require zero skill and can be applied in no time at all.</p>\\n<p><strong>Vaseline Jelly</strong></p>\\n<p>It’s the jar your mum kept in the medicine cabinet way back when. She whipped it out in times of chapped lip crises or used it as a barrier cream when you skinned your knees. You likely tossed yours when you left primary school opting instead for something far more sophisticated, but Vaseline Jelly is well worth keeping at hand.</p>\\n<p>This simple, inexpensive product is a genius moisturiser that’s perfect for dry, cracked hands and hard heels. It’s also the best lip balm going and, a little dab on the apples of your cheeks is an excellent highlighter.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27131219/NicM_1530_RET.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"b8aab2d1-a865-5809-871b-f7e4d53b465c\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/six-beauty-products-youre-not-using.json\n// module id = 686\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Khloe Kardashian shares her hot body secrets\",\"content\":\"<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Success is the best revenge says Khloe Kardashian and she should know.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">The 32-year-old is currently hosting TV’s Revenge Body &#8211; which sees regular women working with the reality star in order to transform their bodies and in doing so their lives. The majority of those who appear on the show have struggled with their weight and more noticeably &#8211; their self-esteem. It’s a battle that Khloe herself knows only too well &#8211; she has fought to keep her weight and under control her entire life.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">She’s also hit various periods of darkness when she gained weight and lost hope.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Today, Khloe, an ambassador for the fitness and weight loss brand Protein World, is in stunning form both physically and mentally.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Here she reveals how she got there &#8211; and how we can too.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Start where you are</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Training is something I’ve grown to love. It’s hard to begin with but once you hit your stride it’s great because you get results. I’ve used Protein World’s Slender Blend as part of my training … having a shake before or after training is a great addition to my routine and has definitely helped me achieve my goals.  For those starting training or already aiming for a goal, my most important advice is to remember we all have to start somewhere. Someone once told me you can&#8217;t get it all in one day. I love that. You have to remember to set realistic goals. Start slowly. But reward yourself when you hit that goal…then set a new one.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Be kind to yourself</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">If you fall off your training regime or you mess up on your diet start again. Get back up and tel yourself, “It’s okay. Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to work out a little bit harder.” We all have days like that. Let it motivate you to be that much better the following day.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Be patient</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">When I first started exercising I was so frustrated. I did not have this body in the first week I started working out. But it’s not easy to build your dream body. If it was we’d all have them. A dream body takes work and perseverance. It takes dedication and literal sweat and tears. That said, when you get there, and you will, it&#8217;s the most rewarding feeling ever.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Be brave</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Beginners, or people who are new to training of any kind, often have fears that have the potential to hold them back from achieving their goals. Intimidation is a huge factor. When walking into a gym, beginners often feel intimidated. Like they are the skinniest or fattest person there or that they are too weak. None of that matters. You’re exercising &#8211; that’s what matters.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Don’t compare</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">We’re all different. We come in different shapes and body types and so need different tools to lose or even gain weight. I suggest getting to know your body until you know what works for you. I started slowly on a diet. I would go week by week taking certain things out of my diet that I should not be eating. I couldn&#8217;t do it all in one day or else I would feel really depriv<br />\\ned and I knew I was going to fail. So week one one I cut out dairy. On week two I cut out sodas. For week three I cut out any juice and only drank water. So on and so forth. That is how I had to operate. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">I understand it might be a slower process but I literally have tried every diet under the sun and this was the way that worked for me. And of course it&#8217;s going to get tough. Anything worth having is worth fighting for. When you hurt the most, when your mind is drained, these are the moments when you must persevere. Only then will you transform mind, body and soul. </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Believe in yourself </span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">All my life I was told that I could never be a certain size or that I could never look a certain way and that really got to me. I started to believe what everybody else told me. But then one day something inside me didn&#8217;t want to be defined by somebody else&#8217;s perception or vision of me. Satisfaction is feeling comfortable in your clothes and knowing that you put in this work and effort and you, all by yourself, got yourself to where you are right now. The best satisfaction is being able to keep up in the gym and feel genuinely bad ass. I train like a beast but I am proud of that! That&#8217;s a compliment! I know I can train with some of the best because I put in the work to get myself here. I did that! And you can too.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"> </span><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Embrace your insecurity </span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">I was always so insecure about my arms. They would never tone up and were mushy and fat. Now I have defined arms and it&#8217;s almost like my trophy that I&#8217;m allowed to show off. It sounds silly, but I&#8217;ve worked so hard on being able to feel comfortable wearing a T-shirt or tank top. Getting my arms to this point took a lot of training and eating right. I never thought I would say that I actually I am proud of my arms but I am.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\"><strong>Drink lemon water</strong> </span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">It sounds a bit weird but lemon water is a huge thing for me. I drink at least three to four litres of water every day. That can get incredibly boring, so I add lemon.</span></p>\\n<p><strong>You can win a Protein World Weight Loss Collection Pack worth $250.</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Simply <a href=\\\"mailto:thebeautyinsider@gmail.com\\\">email us</a> and in 25 words or less let us know why you think you’d benefit from winning.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Entries close April 1, 2017.</span></p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/02145914/side-image-4-vn1-1.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"lifestyle\",\"name\":\"Lifestyle\"},{\"slug\":\"competitions\",\"name\":\"Competitions\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"caf58627-c0e0-58cc-a377-998ab09ec591\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/khloe-kardashian-reveals-body-battles-proved-everybody-wrong.json\n// module id = 687\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Why I’m more beautiful today than ever before\",\"content\":\"<p>We criticise everything and embrace nothing.

Today, you can find green beauty ranges of all types in the most deluxe of department stores, national pharmacies and supermarkets too. And you won’t have to look hard either &#8211; they sell so well they’re placed in the best, most visible areas. The fact is natural is no longer being pushed to the side. Indeed, it is one of the fastest growing sectors of the beauty industry today &#8211; particularly here in Australia where we tend to be deeply enamoured of anything clean and green.</p>\\n<p>Taking a step forward in the public’s consciousness is not the only change. Today’s natural products don’t just sit on the skin (and hair) doing not very much at all. Despite their natural origins and do no harm promises, they are also highly efficacious and well and truly able to provide a significant return. Packaging is sleek and sophisticated meaning your natural products can now take pride of place in the bathroom or on the vanity and when you use them, you can feel good about the fact you’re doing your bit for yourself and also the planet on which we live. One thing to bear in mind. In Australia, the terms relating to natural and green-based products are somewhat loose.</p>\\n<p>“The definition of natural is not only hazy but loosely regulated, so many cosmetic companies can use it to mean whatever they want it to mean,” says Paula Begoun, self-dubbed Cosmetics Cop and founder of the range Paula’s Choice. If you’re serious about being as natural as possible you’ll need to do a little research. The first step, paying very close attention to ingredient labels.</p>\\n<p>Your natural inclination (pun intended) may be to avoid those that appear to be chemically-based. But it’s important to understand that going au naturel is not as simple as it may appear. For starters, plenty of ingredients that we regard as natural may actually be processed in some way in order to make them usable, says Juliette Goggin, co-author of Handmade Beauty (Murdoch Books).</p>\\n<p>“And not all synthetic ingredients are necessarily bad; they may be crucial to improving the performance of a product,” she adds.</p>\\n<p>Bottom line &#8211; familiarise yourself your own skin and hair type and concerns and then find the most natural products that work for you.</p>\\n<p><em>Trilogy Make-Up Be Gone Cleansing Balm, $36.90. trilogyproducts.com</em></p>\\n<p>This rosehip, mango and coconut-based balm removes grime and makeup yet leave the skin supple and soft.</p>\\n<p><em>100% Natural Jojoba Lip Balm, $14.95. thejojobacompany.com.au</em></p>\\n<p>A completely natural lip balm is enriched with jojoba, coconut and Kakadu plum oils.

Not so much.</p>\\n<p>But I want that to change. So I hit them up for their best-ever time-saving makeup tips.</p>\\n<p>Here’s what they had to say.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cheeks and Lips</strong></p>\\n<p>Products that can be used for more than one purpose are super popular with this lot.</p>\\n<p>They love a coloured lip balm that provides a flattering pretty pout but can also be daubed on the cheeks for a soft, shimmery glow.</p>\\n<p><strong>Go Simple</strong></p>\\n<p>Chunky crayon style lip colours and cheek shades make application child’s play. Use this style of cosmetic and you don’t even need a mirror. Well, not a big one anyway.</p>\\n<p>The best and easiest &#8211; lip colour, cheek colour and now, foundation sticks too.</p>\\n<p><strong>Multi-Task</strong></p>\\n<p>A shower is a great place to get clean (obvs) but there’s so much more that you can achieve while in there. Stock yours with products that not only cleanse but also those that whip off dead skin, moisturise or even, build a golden glow.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lash Long Time</strong></p>\\n<p>There’s a vast range of cosmetic treatments that last (and last) and last. Lash tinting is a brilliant way to save several minutes every day and generally lasts for six weeks. Lash extensions (where a therapist glues individual faux lashes onto your own) are one step better and, if treated carefully, might hit eight weeks.</p>\\n<p><strong>Brows Forever</strong></p>\\n<p>Brow tinting is a terrific way to define your brows and brow tattooing is even better, say my beauty ed gaggle. Unlike brow tattooing of yesteryear (think hard, bluish lines) it’s performed with a tiny blade that draws whisper-thin lines into the skin which are then filled with dye for a truly natural effect. Lasts for roughly 18 months.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pretty Ponies</strong></p>\\n<p>A ponytail is the ultimate way to get unruly hair under control. The trick is to make it look polished and sophisticated, rather than, well, slack. Do that by creating a little volume at the crown by teasing with a bristle brush. Gather hair and wrap with non-pull elastic. Take a small section from underneath the pony and wrap it around to cover the elastic. Hold with a Bobbi pin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Concealer Only</strong></p>\\n<p>Foundation is awesome if you have the time. Bit if you’re in a dead set rush it’s easy to get it wrong and frankly &#8211; bare skin is better than poorly applied makeup that everyone can see. Ensure that doesn’t happen by applying a concealer only. Pop it under the eyes (a creamy yellow works best here), in the inner corner of the eyes, around the nose and chin area and over any red areas or teeny flaws.</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27130922/NASTYA_BEAUTY1786.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"d491603c-f599-5a04-81cc-4b3f1ad47bd8\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/seven-steps-perfect-makeup-fast.json\n// module id = 692\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Seven beauty items that will revolutionise your routine\",\"content\":\"<p>My life is crazy hectic.

So do you for that matter. But nobody knows quite so much as your friendly dermatologist. A highly-sought after doctor and ambassador for skincare brand Neutrogena, <a href=\\\"http://www.drninawines.com\\\">Dr Nina Wines</a> knows how to get great skin fast.</p>\\n<p>Here she shares her insider tips.</p>\\n<p><strong>Drink water (but not too much)</strong></p>\\n<p>There’s no evidence that consuming a lot of water gives your skin a more hydrated appearance. Excess water is simply excreted by the kidneys. Too much water can actually be bad for you! Multiple sips throughout the day is far more effective.</p>\\n<p><strong>Moisturise ASAP</strong></p>\\n<p>Apply your serum or moisturiser within three minutes of cleansing. When the skin is wet, the cells are separated and are ripe and ready to suck in more moisture. Yes, it’s true.</p>\\n<p><strong>Choose wisely</strong></p>\\n<p>Serums and moisturisers rich in hyaluronic acid are the most effective way to achieve a fresh hydrated appearance. Apply plenty of moisturiser at bedtime so that it works overnight to give your skin that extra glow the following day.</p>\\n<p><strong>Use serums</strong></p>\\n<p>The beauty of serums is what they don’t contain. Basically it is just the fluid, rich in active ingredients without the occlusive agents, such as mineral oil and petroleum in creams/ointments, which can make the skin look excessively greasy or shiny during the daytime.</p>\\n<p>I tend to recommend thicker moisturisers at night, layered over the top of a serum, and a serum alone beneath a moisturising sunscreen during the day. I also like the textural appearance of serums on the skin applied immediately before foundation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Don’t overdo it</strong></p>\\n<p>Protect the skin when exposed to severe environmental stress. The wind, dry air, chlorine, saunas/spas and extreme environmental temperatures will dry the skin out. Apply serums and moisturisers prior to exposing yourself to environmental extremes and then reapply immediately after exposure.</p>\\n<p><strong>Cleanse gently</strong></p>\\n<p>Avoid excessive use of harsh soap containing cleansers and excessive scrubbing. This will dry you out. Excessive cleansing removes natural protective moisturising factors that we need to retain skin protection and hydration.</p>\\n<p><strong>Live well</strong></p>\\n<p>Your diet counts.

Back then only bikies and ex-cons sported ink &#8211; bikies, ex-cons and me. I delighted in announcing the fact I had a tattoo to all and sundry and insisted on showing not just my friends but complete strangers.</p>\\n<p>Some 20 odd years later and my tattoo collection (six) seemed less rebel chic and more totally naff and so I decided they had to go. I did a little research and decided on a course of PicoSure laser treatments. At my first session the doctor explained that my tattoos would likely need five to seven treatments before disappearing altogether. He also let me know that the treatment can be ‘uncomfortable’. Still, I wanted those suckers gone and so I told him to press on.</p>\\n<p>He fired up the laser, I popped on some dark glasses in order to protect my eyes, and then we got started. As he worked he explained that PicoSure uses patented technology to deliver short pulses of energy into the skin. This energy targets the tattoo ink which then breaks up into tiny particles. These are so small they are then absorbed into the body.</p>\\n<p>Of course, I didn’t really hear anything much because the laser was making a weird crackling noise and it hurt like a million burning suns. Still, five super speedy treatments later, and my clean skin fantasy is close to becoming reality and the ahem&#8230; discomfort has been worth it.</p>\\n<p>PicoSure Tattoo Removal costs vary depending on the size of your tattoo and who carries out your treatment, but you’re likely looking at $500 a go. Do some research before you book in, advises Dr Suzy Bekir of The Taylor Clinic, Double Bay.</p>\\n<p>Ask which type of laser will be used, what type of training and qualifications the practitioner has and how experienced they are at tattoo removal with this particular laser.</p>\\n<p>Learn more at taylorclinic.com.au</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/19103613/d697a105493827f5480e4047cf9dd394.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"skincare\",\"name\":\"Skincare\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"5eb20867-10cc-51a4-bf15-11c73f28fdb2\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/we-try-laser.json\n// module id = 697\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"How to deal with eye lines and wrinkles\",\"content\":\"<p>Smiling at someone you love is one of life&#8217;s greatest pleasures.

You see all of those emotions in the laughter and love lines that form at the corners of the eyes when we smile.</p>\\n<p>But when we’re not actively smiling, talking, or laughing and our faces are at rest, we want the skin around our eyes to be smooth, soft and if at all possible, free of fine lines. It’s not that we’re opposed to ageing &#8211; there’s a lot we love about it &#8211; but neither fine lines or wrinkles fall into that category.</p>\\n<p>So what to do?</p>\\n<p>We could get <strong>muscle freezing injections</strong> to ensure we have absolutely no movement at the corners of our eyes and therefore no visible signs of ageing. But how would we connect with those dear to us? How would we let the world know the love that we’re feeling in that very moment? It’s possible we could not and so there will be no injections for us. Not this week anyway.</p>\\n<p>We’re not willing to take that chance. At least not right now.</p>\\n<p>What we are doing is <strong>applying eye cream</strong> daily.

They’re blonde however which is not awesome at all. Why? Because despite their length and sweet curve they’re pretty much invisible.</p>\\n<p>To combat that problem (first world yes, but a problem nonetheless) I fall back on three different options. Here, a quick run-down of that snappy trio so that you can choose the one that’s right for you.</p>\\n<p><strong>Mascara</strong></p>\\n<p>Mascara is straight-up genius. It was invented back in the late 1800s when women were whipping up their own versions often using a blend of coal dust and petroleum jelly.</p>\\n<p>In the early 1900s, the first commercial mascaras hit the market and the product has been selling like hot cakes ever since. Today’s versions can add length, provide curl, rich colour and even growth-boosting nutrients. The most dramatic colour will always be the blackest of blacks.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Wiggle the wand from base to tip to avoid clumping and do both the underneath and the top of the upper lashes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lash Extensions</strong></p>\\n<p>These are individual lashes which are glued onto your own by a specialised lash therapist. They come in both synthetic and natural varieties. You can opt for very long, more curled or even have them attached to the outer eye only for a sexy doe-eyed look.</p>\\n<p>Before you have them applied your therapist will analyse the shape of your eye and advise you as to which will be most flattering. Lash extensions are terrific in that they last for roughly six weeks so you look beautiful from the moment you well, open your eyes.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Extensions look their best when more natural &#8211; we suggest you skip the showgirl versions.</p>\\n<p><strong>False Lashes</strong></p>\\n<p>These guys used to be super difficult to apply but falsies have come a long way in recent years. Full lash and half lash versions are available as are singles. Chemcorp Beauty Expert Rachael Brook says the version you choose is entirely up to you and also, your eye shape, but she prefers single lashes because they look the most realistic.</p>\\n<p>While false lash application can be difficult to master, a few practise runs and you will get the routine down pat. Promise.</p>\\n<p>Tip: Use a tiny amount of glue on the tip of the individual lash or along the entire band if it’s a full set and wait 30 seconds for the glue to become tacky before you apply, says Rachael. Lay the falsies over your natural lashes &#8211; not your eyelid, she adds.</p>\\n<p><strong>We Love&#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Maybelline New York Colossal Volum’Express Mascara, $19.95. 1300 369 327.</p>\\n<p>Rimmel London 24HR SuperCurler Mascara, $17.95. 1800 812 663.</p>\\n<p>1000 Hour Black Flared Short Individual Re-Usable Lashes, $9.50. 1000hour.com.au</p>\\n<p>For lash extensions hop onto a search engine such as google and search for a salon in your area.

Still, there are tricks to making your mani last… and last… and last, says Shelley Barrett, CEO and founder of ModelCo.</p>\\n<p>The best way to stop your nails chipping is to add both a base coat and top coat to your nail polish routine. The former helps gives your polish extra hold for a longer lasting manicure, while the latter acts as a barrier to stop your colour chipping and fading. It’s the ultimate combination in chip defence.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Another way to be sure your manicure stays tip top all week long is applying a fresh swipe of top coat every morning. Although it may seem taxing, a new top up on the daily will reinforce that protective layer and save you an entire re-paint later on.</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">As for the smudge? Many of us think that if we lay the first coat on thick, we won’t have to go back for round two. This is your number one offender.

Nobody knows hair like a professional stylist. He’s done the time and (if he’s a quality guy) he knows how to cut, colour and do everything in between. He likely also knows a secret tip or three. Turns out he’s willing to share them too. All you have to do is ask. That’s what we did and we very quickly collected a vast number of terrific tips and tricks. Here, our top three all-time favourites.</p>\\n<p>In a serious hurry or have no styling creme or oil to keep your mane well behaved? Dab a small amount of moisturiser onto the palm of one hand, rub both hands together and then run your hands through your hair, from roots to the very tips. Finger comb the product through so that hair is swept back and away from the face. If it’s long enough, tuck behind your ears and voila &#8211; you’re good to go.</p>\\n<p>A professional colour will always look and feel better than an at-home job. But modern life means there isn’t always the time or the cash to hit the salon. Your stylist knows this. Accordingly, he won’t be offended if you ask him to recommend a colour you can use at home to get you through till the next appointment.</p>\\n<p>“A good stylist will understand and will happily give you advice as to which brand and which shade he recommends for you,” says Aleks Abadia, of Esstudio Galleria.</p>\\n<p>Ponytails aren’t just for kids. In fact, they’re the perfect grown-up girl option whether you’re off to the work, coffee or cocktails. The trick is to make the ponytail appropriate.</p>\\n<p>This means a classic, low pony for the office. If you need to bump up the sophistication level, take a small section of the ponytail and wrap it around the elastic before tucking the end with a Bobby Pin.</p>\\n<p>Coffee dates work best with a ponytail that is mid-height with a touch of volume at the crown. Achieve that by gently backcombing a small section at the front.</p>\\n<p>A super-high , super chic pony is perfect for after dark. Use a styler to straighten and add a touch of serum for shine.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27130814/NicM_1534_RET-proof.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"hair\",\"name\":\"Hair\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"70a728ac-1a5c-5bbe-a6ba-5bf582cd5e62\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/salon-sshh.json\n// module id = 704\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"Winter is coming &#8230; Make sure your skin is ready\",\"content\":\"<p>Winter brings with it a raft of super cool stuff.

Here’s how, says Ultraceuticals skin expert Tracey Beeby</p>\\n<p><strong>Winter is here &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>That means skin is more likely to suffer from dryness and dehydration (lipid and moisture loss) due to cold winds, artificial heating, heavier comfort foods, less exercise and long, hot showers.</p>\\n<p><strong>You can prepare for that by &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Upgrading your skin care routine with a good moisturiser and a hydrating serum to keep your skin super hydrated. Additionally, a nourishing or replenishing mask will help replace moisture and repair our skin’s epidermis and skin barrier.</p>\\n<p><strong>Winter skin means always &#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Keep hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day and avoiding those tempting long hot showers. Use the colder season to your advantage as it’s also a great time for treatments such as peels when the sun is not as strong and most of your activity is indoors.</p>\\n<p><strong>And never&#8230;</strong></p>\\n<p>Miss wearing you daily broad spectrum sunscreen.

Use a gentle cream cleanser if you have the minutes to spare. Apply all over, massage gently, then remove with warm water and a soft cloth. No time for that? Grab a cotton pad and soak it with Micellar Water. This snappy little product cleanses, tones and softens skin with one quick wipe. And there’s no need to remove. Bonus!</p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Apply a light moisturiser that will absorb quickly. Smooth across the forehead, down the nose and outwards. Don’t forget your neck and décolletage or you’ll live to regret it (trust me on this). Skip eye cream. Instead, use a standard face moisturiser that is gentle enough for the thinner skin of the eye area.

A deep cream or suede is flattering on all colourings. Apply a second layer of eyeshadow in the crease of the eyelid (the area where the eyelid folds).

You go to…</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">There are some truly excellent facialists in my home town of Sydney. I don’t have a favourite. The one I visited most recently though was Face Plus Medi Spa in Bondi Junction. The herbal peels here are genius. They feel a little like being sand-papered so it&#8217;s not a super relaxing treatment, but it leaves skin looking beautifully dewy fresh and plump. And there are relaxing facial treatments too if that&#8217;s more your thing.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Your favourite hair stylists are…</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">I swear by Anthony Nader at RAW for all things hair. I&#8217;m an Estudio Galleria fan too. Both salons are warm and welcoming and don&#8217;t have that &#8216;you&#8217;re not cool enough to be in here vibe&#8217;. Even my kids get their hair cut by Anthony. He&#8217;s charming, funny, sweet and an awesome hairdresser. Aleks at Estudio is my go-to when I want to funk it up a little and he does a killer blow out.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">And lashes&#8230;</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Lashes are with Amy Jean Linehan, at Amy Jean Eye Couture. I wear lash extensions all-year round and Amy Jean is my girl. I have had some disasters in my time and I never want to take that chance again. I mean, this is my face we&#8217;re talking about! If I can&#8217;t get in to see AJ I head Love Those Lashes or Lady Lash.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">And brows?</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Also, AJ if I can snaffle an appointment. She’s incredibly busy. She’s not particularly cheap, but I&#8217;m a believer in the concept that you get what you pay for. I also love Benefit for Brows. Quick, easy and a bargain.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">A whole day of luxe treatments would take place where? </span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Oh my&#8230; This is never going to happen. But, if I could pull it off I&#8217;d head to The Spa at The Park Hyatt. You can tailor your own treatments and make a day of it. I&#8217;d get an aromatherapy massage and a full body scrub of some kind. A pedicure and a manicure is a must plus a rejuvenating facial. I&#8217;d be needing to drink French champagne the entire time of course.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">If you wanted laser you’d head to…</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">This really depends on the type. If it&#8217;s hair removal laser I&#8217;m pretty happy with the chains that do inexpensive deals although I inspect the premises closely beforehand and do a little asking around as to who is best. For anti-ageing and rejuvenating laser treatments I love Dr Jeremy Cumpston at Ageless Clinic and also Anne Pilley at Zecca Cosmedical.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">If you could only get one treatment a month, what would you get and where would you go?</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">A pedicure. Definitely. You can&#8217;t go past The Nail Lab in Darlinghurst. The staff there are quick, do a beautiful job and the salon is bright, fresh and sparkling clean. It&#8217;s kind of gross how many aren&#8217;t!</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">How do you rate the quality and range of services in Australia in terms of beauty?</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">If you&#8217;re looking for top notch beauty treatments you’re in the right place. You can get everything you need in this neck of the woods and you can rest easy knowing you&#8217;re dealing with the best there is.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Most under-rated treatment is…</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">I think that fillers can do amazing things in terms of changing face shape, providing you with more flattering features and generally holding back the clock. That said, you do need to select a practitioner carefully. You want someone who prefers a more natural, subtle look. I can&#8217;t recommend Natalie Abouchar at Privee Clinic highly enough.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><strong><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Does pampering really matter?</span></strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">It&#8217;s a cliche but women tend to put themselves last.

But carving out the time (and the cash) means that for most of us salon visits are a rare luxury. The great news is that with just a little bit of effort on your part, you can create salon style hair in the privacy of your own home and spend very little money while you’re at it.</p>\\n<p><strong>Curl Up</strong></p>\\n<p>Take a round barrel heated tong and wrap a two-to-three-inch section of hair around it, says stylist Anthony Nader of RAW Hair Salon. Remove the tong, press the curl flat and slide in a large pin so that it holds its shape.</p>\\n<p>Do this with about eight sections of hair focusing on the hair that frames your face. Allow drying before removing the pins to reveal sexy loose curls.</p>\\n<p>VS Sassoon Big Hair Soft Curls Styler, $42.95. vssassoon.com.au</p>\\n<p><strong>Kill the Frizz</strong></p>\\n<p>Professional hair means zero frizz.

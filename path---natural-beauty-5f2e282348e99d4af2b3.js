Today, you can find green beauty ranges of all types in the most deluxe of department stores, national pharmacies and supermarkets too. And you won’t have to look hard either &#8211; they sell so well they’re placed in the best, most visible areas. The fact is natural is no longer being pushed to the side. Indeed, it is one of the fastest growing sectors of the beauty industry today &#8211; particularly here in Australia where we tend to be deeply enamoured of anything clean and green.</p>\n<p>Taking a step forward in the public’s consciousness is not the only change. Today’s natural products don’t just sit on the skin (and hair) doing not very much at all. Despite their natural origins and do no harm promises, they are also highly efficacious and well and truly able to provide a significant return. Packaging is sleek and sophisticated meaning your natural products can now take pride of place in the bathroom or on the vanity and when you use them, you can feel good about the fact you’re doing your bit for yourself and also the planet on which we live. One thing to bear in mind. In Australia, the terms relating to natural and green-based products are somewhat loose.</p>\n<p>“The definition of natural is not only hazy but loosely regulated, so many cosmetic companies can use it to mean whatever they want it to mean,” says Paula Begoun, self-dubbed Cosmetics Cop and founder of the range Paula’s Choice. If you’re serious about being as natural as possible you’ll need to do a little research. The first step, paying very close attention to ingredient labels.</p>\n<p>Your natural inclination (pun intended) may be to avoid those that appear to be chemically-based. But it’s important to understand that going au naturel is not as simple as it may appear. For starters, plenty of ingredients that we regard as natural may actually be processed in some way in order to make them usable, says Juliette Goggin, co-author of Handmade Beauty (Murdoch Books).</p>\n<p>“And not all synthetic ingredients are necessarily bad; they may be crucial to improving the performance of a product,” she adds.</p>\n<p>Bottom line &#8211; familiarise yourself your own skin and hair type and concerns and then find the most natural products that work for you.</p>\n<p><em>Trilogy Make-Up Be Gone Cleansing Balm, $36.90. trilogyproducts.com</em></p>\n<p>This rosehip, mango and coconut-based balm removes grime and makeup yet leave the skin supple and soft.</p>\n<p><em>100% Natural Jojoba Lip Balm, $14.95. thejojobacompany.com.au</em></p>\n<p>A completely natural lip balm is enriched with jojoba, coconut and Kakadu plum oils.

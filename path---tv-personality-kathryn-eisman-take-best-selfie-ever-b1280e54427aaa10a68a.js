Blonde and impossibly lovely &#8211; at least, that&#8217;s how she appears in every selfie in her social media feed. Her skin is flawless, her teeth a blinding white. Her eyes sparkle. And those thighs? Longer and more elegant than anything you&#8217;ve ever seen in your life.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. As a fashion and lifestyle reporter who spends much of her life appearing on the small screen, Kathryn, 36, knows how to pose for a perfect pic. Yes. She actually is staggeringly pretty in person.</p>\n<p>But, and she will be the first person to tell you this, she is absolutely not perfect. She just knows how to work a camera angle &#8211; and very, very well.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2633" style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2633" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102343/JPG-Kathryn-teeth-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102343/JPG-Kathryn-teeth-290x300.jpg 290w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102343/JPG-Kathryn-teeth.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@kathryneisman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The great news is she says this is something we can all learn. And when we do, it will be 100 per cent banging selfie time for us too. So here goes &#8230; drum roll please &#8230; Kathryn&#8217;s top tips.</p>\n<p>Always take the shot from above</p>\n<p>Take it from a far enough distance so that your features aren’t distorted and enormous (definitely full-arm&#8217;s length or even, the dreaded selfie stick!)</p>\n<p>Don’t use “portrait” mode. It&#8217;s great for taking pics of other people, but shows way too much detail for a selfie and is not good for one’s self esteem.</p>\n<p>And there it is. Your perfect selfie awaits!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2634" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2634" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102504/JPG-Kathryn-wedding-300x290.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="290" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102504/JPG-Kathryn-wedding-300x290.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102504/JPG-Kathryn-wedding.jpg 613w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@kathryneisman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to not worry too, too much about such things. We know, we know &#8230; we&#8217;re doing a bit of a turn-around here. But we do adore an honest Instagram selfie too &#8211; as does Kathryn who refers to the medium as &#8216;Insta-sham&#8217;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m all for looking gorgeous in a pic,&#8221; says Kathryn, who recently launched the blog <a href="http://highheeljungle.com">HighHeelJungle.</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I want the blog to be as aspirational as the pages of Vogue, but I also want there to be truth about the manufacturing of these images so women actually feel empowered rather than inadequate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And this is something Kathryn feels particularly strongly about.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2635" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2635" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102553/Kathryn-JPG-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102553/Kathryn-JPG-300x228.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19102553/Kathryn-JPG.jpg 596w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@kathryneisman</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What bothers me most of all are those fake candid shots which everyone uses on insta-sham these days,&#8221; she adds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You know the ones of people looking off in the distance or laughing like no one is looking even though they clearly have a professional camera crew taking the photo! I’m sure I’m guilty of these too, but I want to honest about it. That’s why I created <a href="http://highheeljungle.com">HighHeelJungle</a> &#8230; to reveal the truth behind these false sense of perfection that people peddle on social media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>See! You love her now right? Yep.

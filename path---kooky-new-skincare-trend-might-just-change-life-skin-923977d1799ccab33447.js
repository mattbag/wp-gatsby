Think about it. Anti-wrinkle. Anti-ageing. Even Anti-acne. Labels that immediately highlight our defects and how we aren’t good enough.</p>\n<p>Founder of <a href="https://alyssumalchemy.com.au">Alyssum Alchemy</a> Alison Gallagher has and it pisses her off. So much so that she&#8217;s determined to do things differently. And so far, so awesome.</p>\n<p>The Alyssum Alchemy range is not only bursting with organic, potent and healing natural ingredients rich in antioxidants and vitamins to support skin health and radiance, it&#8217;s carefully labelled and in a super cool way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have consciously only used language which supports a positive body/self image,&#8221; says <a href="https://alyssumalchemy.com.au/pages/alison-gallagher">Alison.</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I took the concept further by infusing the skin care with rose quartz (which supports compassion) and gem and flower essences chosen specifically to help support a more positive attitude towards how we perceive ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alison goes onto say that the daily practice of applying our skincare shouldn&#8217;t be focusing on fixing ourselves as opposed to celebrating our genuine, unique gorgeous selves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A celebration of ourselves and how unique and special we are,&#8221; says Alison.</p>\n<p>Alison takes this concept pretty seriously. Her range is housed in glass bottles etched with positive affirmations too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My range promotes daily rituals where can we lavish our skin and body with divine smelling nourishing ingredients to support the health of our skin, but also nurture our spirit and promote feelings of self worth,&#8221; she explains.</p>\n<p>And we are totally on board with that.</p>\n<p>Because the thing is, skincare can only do so much, even when scientifically formulated and with top-quality ingredients. Feelings of self-worth and self-love are what will really provide a gorgeous glow. Give it a try. Today.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2422" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2422" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214335/Rose-group-JPG-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214335/Rose-group-JPG-300x184.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214335/Rose-group-JPG-768x472.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214335/Rose-group-JPG-1024x629.jpg 1024w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214335/Rose-group-JPG.jpg 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Does it work? Alison says yes &#8211; and in a major way.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>One More Thing &#8230; About That Rose Quartz </strong></p>\n<p>We love the positive spin of this range. We&#8217;ve made that clear. But at heart, we like our skincare products to be a little high-tech and the idea that this range contains <a href="https://alyssumalchemy.com.au/collections/sacred-skincare/products/queen-of-roses-gift-pack">rose quartz </a>is cool but it did make us wonder &#8230; Does it really serve any purpose?</p>\n<p>Alison says absolutely. And she explains it like this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything is energy,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our intentions, our food, our space, our emotions, the things we touch and smell, they all vibrate at a certain frequency. Einstein was the first to reveal this through his research.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Crystals have a unique crystalline structure which gives them a vibrational integrity supportive for healing. I also believe using crystals helps us to feel more connected to the earth (as crystals have all come from deep within the earth).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sounds pretty valid to us. But it was this last piece of info that really won us over.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The colour of rose quartz, a soft pink, aligns with the heart chakra which governs compassion, healing and trust,&#8221; says Alison.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By infusing my skincare range with this crystal, the products emit the healing frequency of rose quartz which can aid feelings of self worth, balance the heart chakra and increase compassion.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2425" style="width: 226px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2425" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-226x300.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-226x300.jpg 226w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG-770x1024.jpg 770w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24214817/alchemy-two-JPG.jpg 951w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Made with quality stuff &#8211; and a whole lot of love too.</figcaption></figure>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24213250/Alison.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"lifestyle",name:"Lifestyle"},{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"2042c38a-0101-5ec9-8726-b05d30465280"}}}});

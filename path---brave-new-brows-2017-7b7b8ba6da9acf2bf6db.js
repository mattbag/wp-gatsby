They&#8217;re full and dare we say, fluffy!</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re brushed up and out and richly coloured and, the very daring anyway, are even combing small parts down the centre so that the hairs go in different directions. <strong>For real.</strong></p>\n<p>The style that we&#8217;re loving the most right now, however, is what we like to refer to as the #BOSSGIRL brow.</p>\n<p>Why? Because it&#8217;s a strong, bold and confident brow that says I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m ready to do business. Like the sound of that? <strong>Well good news</strong> &#8211; we know how to create it. Well,  <strong>Hannah Terrett, national brow artist for Benefit</strong> does anyway, and luckily for us she&#8217;s willing to teach us. Firstly, a word from Hannah herself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to create a look that encouraged women to be bold yet still feminine,&#8221; says Hannah.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To me, this brow style represents <strong>being fearless, taking risks</strong> and owning them. I guess to put it simply it&#8217;s bold and beautiful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This particular style is fluffier and more textured than the average brow with a more defined edge and tail. You can have it created by any brow artist or do it yourself <strong>(see steps below)</strong>. But, throughout the month of May $10 from every brow wax at <a href="https://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/beauty/benefit-Beauty-Services">Benefit at Myer</a> will be donated to the brand&#8217;s three chosen charities &#8211; <a href="https://lgfb.org.au">Look Good, Feel Better</a>, <a href="https://fittedforwork.org">Fitted For Work</a> and <a href="http://www.sister2sister.com.au">Sister2Sister</a>.  And we love that.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-1987 alignleft" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16225006/Benefit-Cosmetics-Brow-Zings-55-available-at-Myer-157x300.jpg" alt="" width="157" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16225006/Benefit-Cosmetics-Brow-Zings-55-available-at-Myer-157x300.jpg 157w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16225006/Benefit-Cosmetics-Brow-Zings-55-available-at-Myer-768x1464.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16225006/Benefit-Cosmetics-Brow-Zings-55-available-at-Myer-537x1024.jpg 537w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16225006/Benefit-Cosmetics-Brow-Zings-55-available-at-Myer.jpg 1574w" sizes="(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px" />\n<p>Maybe hit Benefit in May for a wax and then aim to maintain this gorgeous style of brow by doing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Apply <a href="https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/au/en-gb/product/ka-brow"><strong>Ka-Brow</strong> <strong>Eyebrow Cream Gel Colour, $42</strong></a>, to the outer edges of the brow by tracing the outline of the shape using a defined angle brush.</em></li>\n<li><em>Fill in the body or middle of the brow extending out to the tail using Ka-Brow in a shade deeper than your hair tone.

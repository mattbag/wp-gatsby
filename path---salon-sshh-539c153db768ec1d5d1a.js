Nobody knows hair like a professional stylist. He’s done the time and (if he’s a quality guy) he knows how to cut, colour and do everything in between. He likely also knows a secret tip or three. Turns out he’s willing to share them too. All you have to do is ask. That’s what we did and we very quickly collected a vast number of terrific tips and tricks. Here, our top three all-time favourites.</p>\n<p>In a serious hurry or have no styling creme or oil to keep your mane well behaved? Dab a small amount of moisturiser onto the palm of one hand, rub both hands together and then run your hands through your hair, from roots to the very tips. Finger comb the product through so that hair is swept back and away from the face. If it’s long enough, tuck behind your ears and voila &#8211; you’re good to go.</p>\n<p>A professional colour will always look and feel better than an at-home job. But modern life means there isn’t always the time or the cash to hit the salon. Your stylist knows this. Accordingly, he won’t be offended if you ask him to recommend a colour you can use at home to get you through till the next appointment.</p>\n<p>“A good stylist will understand and will happily give you advice as to which brand and which shade he recommends for you,” says Aleks Abadia, of Esstudio Galleria.</p>\n<p>Ponytails aren’t just for kids. In fact, they’re the perfect grown-up girl option whether you’re off to the work, coffee or cocktails. The trick is to make the ponytail appropriate.</p>\n<p>This means a classic, low pony for the office. If you need to bump up the sophistication level, take a small section of the ponytail and wrap it around the elastic before tucking the end with a Bobby Pin.</p>\n<p>Coffee dates work best with a ponytail that is mid-height with a touch of volume at the crown. Achieve that by gently backcombing a small section at the front.</p>\n<p>A super-high , super chic pony is perfect for after dark. Use a styler to straighten and add a touch of serum for shine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27130814/NicM_1534_RET-proof.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"hair",name:"Hair"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"70a728ac-1a5c-5bbe-a6ba-5bf582cd5e62"}}}});

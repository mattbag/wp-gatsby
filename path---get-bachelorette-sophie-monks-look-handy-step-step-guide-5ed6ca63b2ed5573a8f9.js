Social media is full of chatter about how sweet and kind this year&#8217;s Bachelorette is with her genuine concern for those around her being noted over and over again.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also much talk about Sohpie&#8217;s charming (okay also raucous) laugh and her wacky and loveable sense of humour.</p>\n<p>We love all of that of course, but we&#8217;re also utterly enamoured of her looks. That face! Indeed, we love this Bachelorette so much we want to look just like her. Given that, we figure you might like to know how too. So, here we go.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3238" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3238" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23205509/JPG-Sophie-M-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23205509/JPG-Sophie-M-240x300.jpg 240w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23205509/JPG-Sophie-M.jpg 476w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sexy, sultry Sophie.

Once done, press into the skin with the palms of your hands for a dewy, fresh look.</p>\n<p>Add concealer where needed. Don&#8217;t forget the inner corner of the eye, the outside corners of the lips and around the nose.</p>\n<p>Sweep a blush across the high points of the cheekbones. If you like a chiselled look, apply a darker shade under the cheekbones and blend. Add a spot of shimmer highlighter on the very highest points.</p>\n<p>Brows should be simple. Apply a few light strokes of brow pencil and fill in any visible spars patches or areas. Use a brow brush to brush upwards for a flattering natural effect.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3243" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211805/Brow-Satin-Duo-300x62.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="62" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211805/Brow-Satin-Duo-300x62.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211805/Brow-Satin-Duo-768x159.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211805/Brow-Satin-Duo-1024x213.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><strong>Try Maybelline New York Brow Satin Duo, $16.95.</strong></p>\n<p>Next, brush a wash of soft bronze shadow from lash line to brow. Apply a richer, darker shade along the upper lash line and beneath the lower lash line too. Smudge with a fingertip or fine shadow brush.</p>\n<p>Carefully apply a rich, dark line of eyeliner along the water line of the lower lid. Squeeze lids tightly to smudge.</p>\n<p>Add, layers and layers of mascara. If you like a very sexy eye, dot three or four single false lashes at the outer corner of the eye.</p>\n<p>Now, lipstick. Apply a matte nude shade over the entire lip. Then, smudge a small amount of a matte nude lipstick that&#8217;s one shade darker in the very centre of your lower lip. This provides a full, pouty effect.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3241" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211441/CS-Matte-Nudes-Almond-Rose-bd-244x300.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211441/CS-Matte-Nudes-Almond-Rose-bd-244x300.jpg 244w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211441/CS-Matte-Nudes-Almond-Rose-bd-768x945.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23211441/CS-Matte-Nudes-Almond-Rose-bd-832x1024.jpg 832w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" />\n<p><strong>Sophie personally recommends Maybelline New York Sensational Matte Nude Lip Colour in Almond Rose, $17.95.</strong></p>\n<p>And voila!

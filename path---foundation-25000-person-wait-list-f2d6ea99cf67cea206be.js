Foundation</strong>.</p>\n<p>You see, a quality foundation has the power to quite literally transform and women know that.</p>\n<p>Make the right choice and it can camouflage flaws such as fine lines and pigmentation, take you from ruddy to glowing, hide spots and rough patches and do it all in a flash. <strong>Plenty of foundations these days also contain active ingredients so function as skincare too.</strong> They also come with SPF so frankly, there&#8217;s a lot to like.</p>\n<p>When a great one hits the stores we want you to know about it. And this one is GREAT. Of course, we&#8217;re talking about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSV_VJ_hSjA/?taken-by=deciem&amp;hl=en">The Ordinary Colours Foundation range by Deciem</a> &#8211; a foundation that&#8217;s so damned awesomeÂ that there&#8217;s currently a 25,000 wait list in the US.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1487" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08220925/2017-02-17-Ordinary-Colours-Group-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08220925/2017-02-17-Ordinary-Colours-Group-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08220925/2017-02-17-Ordinary-Colours-Group-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08220925/2017-02-17-Ordinary-Colours-Group-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08220925/2017-02-17-Ordinary-Colours-Group-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><em>Foundation that does everything a quality foundation should and costs less than a fancy lunch? LOVE.</em></p>\n<p>Why? A couple of reasons. Firstly, there&#8217;s two different formulations. <strong>Serum Foundation</strong> gives a natural-looking medium coverage with light silky texture.<strong> Coverage Foundation</strong> is creamy and rich in pigment but still provides a natural finish.</p>\n<p>Both are long-lasting but look super natural &#8211; all-day. So the foundations themselves are awesome and do everything a quality foundation should. They both contain an SPF of 15 &#8211; also excellent. But here&#8217;s the two super important points. First &#8211; they come in 21 shades so ALL skin tones are catered for.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondly &#8211; the cost is astounding</strong>. The serum version is just <strong>$12.70</strong>. The coverage version &#8211; <strong>$12.90</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now you know why 25,000 are already desperate for one to call their own.</p>\n<p>The Ordinary Colours Foundations will be available in Deciem stores in <a href="https://deciem.com/contact/stores">Melbourne</a> and <a href="https://deciem.com/contact/stores">Sydney</a> from late April. They&#8217;ll also sell <a href="http://deciem.com/default">online</a>. Our advice &#8211; hurry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08220959/2017-03-01-Ordinary-Colours-Lifestyle.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"24b07aa2-6009-5438-ac66-210f220426e2"}}}});

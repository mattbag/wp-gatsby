I like applying a <strong>weekly conditioning treatment</strong>. For a mega-watt shine add a few drops of a tone-on-tone hair colour to the treatment (making sure it’s a colour match) and leave for 15 minutes. Rinse well and finish with a cool rinse.</p>\\n<p>Remember to slather on a <strong>daily body moisturiser</strong>  &#8211; a beauty step that is often forgotten. Focus on elbows, knees and feet. A smooth and sexy sheen all over is a definite head turner!</p>\\n<p>And lastly, <strong>smile and laugh</strong> a lot.

She is known for somehow being able to provide a truly natural-looking, golden glow. Fiona calls her technique &#8216;skin finishing&#8217; because it involves bronzing, but also includes contouring to add definition to the body. Hello abs! Her celebrity clients include Kim Kardashian, Amy Poehler, Evangeline Lilly and Olivia Wilde.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_1579\\\" style=\\\"width: 300px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-1579\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14184625/Kim-Jpg-300x203.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"203\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14184625/Kim-Jpg-300x203.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14184625/Kim-Jpg.jpg 596w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Kim Kardashian at her shiny best.

I like applying a <strong>weekly conditioning treatment</strong>. For a mega-watt shine add a few drops of a tone-on-tone hair colour to the treatment (making sure it’s a colour match) and leave for 15 minutes. Rinse well and finish with a cool rinse.</p>\\n<p>Remember to slather on a <strong>daily body moisturiser</strong>  &#8211; a beauty step that is often forgotten. Focus on elbows, knees and feet. A smooth and sexy sheen all over is a definite head turner!</p>\\n<p>And lastly, <strong>smile and laugh</strong> a lot. It really will radiate your inner beauty!</p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14185210/Olivia-Wilde-jpg.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"beauty-talk\",\"name\":\"Beauty Talk\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"f44d14c7-9cf0-5007-af74-07484fa1eb5e\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/beauty-editors-guide-la.json\n// module id = 777\n// module chunks = 193425244991340"],"sourceRoot":""}

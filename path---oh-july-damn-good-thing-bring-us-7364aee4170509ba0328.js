But even we don&#8217;t want to work through that many products, tips and treatments before we know what&#8217;s worth looking at and, conversely, what to avoid at all costs.</div>\n<div>That brings us to <strong>The Beauty Insider&#8217;s official Top 10</strong>.</div>\n<div>This is a list of what we regard as the best new products on counter right this very second.</div>\n<div>How do we know these are the very best of the best?

It brings wisdom, an inner peace that most of us just didn’t have in our younger years and confidence too. Unfortunately though getting older is not without its downside. Take, fine lines and wrinkles for example. And yes those annoying little sun spots. The great news is that you can ease, and also camouflage, pretty much all of those and without a needle to be seen.</p>\n<p>Here’s how.</p>\n<p><strong>Moisturise</strong></p>\n<p>“A brilliant moisturiser can go a long way towards improving skin’s texture, enhancing its radiance, and creating a smoother, younger, more supple appearance,” says Paula Begoun, creator of the beauty brand Paula’s Choice and author of Don’t Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me (Beginning Press).</p>\n<p>AVON Nutra Effects Hydration Daily Cream SPF15, $15. avon.com.au</p>\n<p><strong>Cover</strong></p>\n<p>Today’s foundations are super high-tech. They go on easy and hide any teeny tiny flaws you might have. Some even come with extra benefits such as light-reflecting particles which give skin a faux glow making it appear more fresh and youthful.</p>\n<p>Bourjois Paris City Radiance Skin Protecting Foundation, $29. bourjois.com.au</p>\n<p><strong>Pinch Your Cheeks</strong></p>\n<p>This trick is as old as time and always popular. Why? because it works. “Picking your cheeks lightly gets the blood flowing to the face, restoring a little glow and giving the skin a youthful-looking flush,” says Sali Hughes, makeup artist and author of Pretty Honest &#8211; The Straight-Talking Beauty Companion (HarperCollins).</p>\n<p><strong>Lash Out</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing takes the years off quite like super long, flirty lashes. They make eyes appear bigger and sexier, plus lashes that are thick and curled up do a genius job of hiding any sagging skin. For the most dramatic effect, use black and apply from the very roots of the lashes and coat both sides.</p>\n<p>Covergirl Plumpify blastPRO Mascara in Very Black, $21.95. covergirl.com.au</p>\n<p><strong>Go Bold</strong></p>\n<p>Growing up means losing colour. Hair begins to fade and even lip colour becomes less noticeable than in your younger years. Overcome that by applying a bright, bold shade of lip gloss or lipstick. Steer clear of matte versions which can be drying and may highlight fine lines.</p>\n<p>Rimmel London Moisture Renew Sheer and Shine in Pink Rules, $13.95. au.rimmellondon.com</p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/02145957/Stocksy_txp15de09b2UEO100_Medium_744329.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"0e85f9d4-9772-57d4-8651-ceeae6057137"}}}});

The Hollywood A-Lister and mother has signed up with the ultra deluxe natural skincare brand<a href="https://truebotanicals.com"> True Botanicals</a>. But, according to a report in WWD, the star will be doing far more than just flashing that pretty face and announcing she likes the stuff.</p>\n<p>No, not Olivia. As per usual, the star has done something considerably more important and signed on with the brand not as an ambassador but as its chief brand activist.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2052" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2052" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200742/Olivia-and-son-J-253x300.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200742/Olivia-and-son-J-253x300.jpg 253w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200742/Olivia-and-son-J.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@oliviawilde</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re part of a growing number of business thinking about sustainable practises and changing the norms in our industry, Christina Mace-Turner, True Botanicals CEO told <a href="http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/olivia-wilde-true-botanicals-chief-brand-activist-10889967/">WWD</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Olivia completely got what we were doing and it felt like a very natural partnership.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For her part Olivia seems genuinely chuffed with the new partnership and role.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to be part of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/truebotanicals/">True Botanicals</a> as an advocate and help spread the word about the important mission they&#8217;re on, whether it&#8217;s talking to consumers and vouching for it personally, testifying before congress, learning about the reproach behind the need for these non-toxic products, leaning about clinical trials, or becoming involved in the actual product development,&#8221; she was quoted as saying in WWD.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2053" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2053" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200913/truebotanicals-J-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200913/truebotanicals-J-300x298.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200913/truebotanicals-J-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200913/truebotanicals-J.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@truebotanicals</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The group is hailing <a href="http://the-beautyinsider.com/beauty-editors-guide-la/">Olivia&#8217;s</a> role as less face of and more social activist for and the actress (whose ambassadorial contract with Revlon recently expired) is delighted by that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I get to say I was part of the solution and tell my kids, &#8216;I worked really hard to make sure you had an alternative&#8217;,&#8221; she told WWD.</p>\n<p>So there it is. Natural, green, organic skincare &#8230; Not so long back you&#8217;d find it on dusty back shelves and piled high in bargain baskets in health food stores.

Some of that is simply part of a worldwide movement towards caring for our planet (and ourselves) better than we have in the past.</p>\n<p>Part of it though is due to the market embracing this once obscure trend (likely because they see money can be made here) and, because A+ celebrities, such as Olivia, are endorsing natural skincare lines with gusto. We&#8217;re not trying to say they don&#8217;t believe in the brand &#8211; or the green movement in general, far from it &#8211; but when the world&#8217;s most well-known, admired and beautiful women embrace a brand then it&#8217;s not hard to imaging what comes next &#8230;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2055" style="width: 246px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2055" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20201200/Olivia-fur-J-246x300.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20201200/Olivia-fur-J-246x300.jpg 246w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20201200/Olivia-fur-J.jpg 466w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@oliviawilde</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The products spike in popularity and sales. But heck, if they truly are green and True Botanicals is, and are helping give back to our planet, our world, then we&#8217;re all for it. And with that we&#8217;d like to say we are officially on board.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/20200544/Olivia-plus-two-J.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"beauty-talk",name:"Beauty Talk"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"c86324eb-8aae-5470-b7cd-b53d13880006"}}}});

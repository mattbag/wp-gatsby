You want muscle freezing injections, fillers or even a facelift, we&#8217;re good with that. What we&#8217;re not good with is not doing a little homework before you book in. This is your face after all.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s look at muscle freezing injections such as <strong>Botox and Dysport</strong> first of all. We&#8217;ve tried both and had excellent results. But this industry has changed an awful lot in recent years and continues to do so. Given that, we figured a quick update couldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>\n<p>Take it away <strong>Charlie Abboud</strong>, Head of Injectables at<a href="http://www.laserclinics.com.au"> Laser Clinics Australia</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the most attractive aspects of Cosmetic Injectables?</strong></p>\n<p>Non invasive, quick and easy treatments,<br />\nLong lasting results,<br />\nConvenient and affordable,<br />\nAnd treatments are tailored to suit client&#8217;s needs</p>\n<p><strong>How do they work?</strong></p>\n<p>Anti-wrinkle injections are made from a <strong>purified protein that causes facial muscles to relax,</strong> softening lines and reducing the severity of visible wrinkles. This decrease of movement in the muscle creates less stress on the skin, helping to maintain a fresh, youthful and rejuvenated appearance.<br />\nThe injections actively prevent the formation of static wrinkles (deeper lines and folds caused by repeated movement over time).</p>\n<p><strong>What is new in the field?</strong></p>\n<p>Results are no longer so &#8216;fake looking&#8217;. Not that long ago it was the perception that you would walk in and then walk out<strong> looking very overdone and frozen</strong>. Techniques, training and products can now deliver results ranging from glamorous, to more subtle &#8211; depending on a client&#8217;s needs. Some clients do not want anyone to know they have had cosmetic injections &#8211; they want to look naturally refreshed and youthful, without and obvious change. We can achieve that.</p>\n<p><strong>What areas can be treated?</strong></p>\n<p>Anti-wrinkle injections start to work <strong>two to three days after the injection</strong> and reach their full effect within seven to 14 days. The effects can typically last for up to three to four months depending on the individual.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost please &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Prices vary depending on where you have your treatment carried out and how many units of product you use. At <a href="http://www.laserclinics.com.au">Laser Clinics Australia</a> prices start from $99 per area or $3.95 per unit. A forehead would be a single area for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Main image by Lucas Dawson for Myer.</strong></p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15222906/Myer-photos-by-Lucas-Dawson-18.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"159a4544-a588-5f61-87aa-9df43b5879a2"}}}});

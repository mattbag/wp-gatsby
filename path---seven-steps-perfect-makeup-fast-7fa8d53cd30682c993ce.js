After years in the business they can apply a full face in less than five minutes flat meaning they always look impossibly beautiful no matter how hectic their schedule.</p>\n<p>Me on the other hand? Not so much.</p>\n<p>But I want that to change. So I hit them up for their best-ever time-saving makeup tips.</p>\n<p>Here’s what they had to say.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheeks and Lips</strong></p>\n<p>Products that can be used for more than one purpose are super popular with this lot.</p>\n<p>They love a coloured lip balm that provides a flattering pretty pout but can also be daubed on the cheeks for a soft, shimmery glow.</p>\n<p><strong>Go Simple</strong></p>\n<p>Chunky crayon style lip colours and cheek shades make application child’s play. Use this style of cosmetic and you don’t even need a mirror. Well, not a big one anyway.</p>\n<p>The best and easiest &#8211; lip colour, cheek colour and now, foundation sticks too.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Task</strong></p>\n<p>A shower is a great place to get clean (obvs) but there’s so much more that you can achieve while in there. Stock yours with products that not only cleanse but also those that whip off dead skin, moisturise or even, build a golden glow.</p>\n<p><strong>Lash Long Time</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a vast range of cosmetic treatments that last (and last) and last. Lash tinting is a brilliant way to save several minutes every day and generally lasts for six weeks. Lash extensions (where a therapist glues individual faux lashes onto your own) are one step better and, if treated carefully, might hit eight weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Brows Forever</strong></p>\n<p>Brow tinting is a terrific way to define your brows and brow tattooing is even better, say my beauty ed gaggle. Unlike brow tattooing of yesteryear (think hard, bluish lines) it’s performed with a tiny blade that draws whisper-thin lines into the skin which are then filled with dye for a truly natural effect. Lasts for roughly 18 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Pretty Ponies</strong></p>\n<p>A ponytail is the ultimate way to get unruly hair under control. The trick is to make it look polished and sophisticated, rather than, well, slack. Do that by creating a little volume at the crown by teasing with a bristle brush. Gather hair and wrap with non-pull elastic. Take a small section from underneath the pony and wrap it around to cover the elastic. Hold with a Bobbi pin.</p>\n<p><strong>Concealer Only</strong></p>\n<p>Foundation is awesome if you have the time. Bit if you’re in a dead set rush it’s easy to get it wrong and frankly &#8211; bare skin is better than poorly applied makeup that everyone can see. Ensure that doesn’t happen by applying a concealer only. Pop it under the eyes (a creamy yellow works best here), in the inner corner of the eyes, around the nose and chin area and over any red areas or teeny flaws.</p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27130922/NASTYA_BEAUTY1786.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"d491603c-f599-5a04-81cc-4b3f1ad47bd8"}}}});

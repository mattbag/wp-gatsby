Do it.</div>\n<div>If you did you would now have a mere 251 million results to sift through.</div>\n<div>Now don&#8217;t get us wrong. We LOVE beauty. We&#8217;re mad for it. But even we don&#8217;t want to work through that many products, tips and treatments before we know what&#8217;s worth looking at and, conversely, what to avoid at all costs.</div>\n<div>That brings us to <strong>The Beauty Insider&#8217;s official Top 10</strong>.</div>\n<div>This is a list of what we regard as the best new products on counter right this very second.</div>\n<div>How do we know these are the very best of the best? Because we have tried and tested every single one. We&#8217;ve looked at texture, scent, efficacy and of course, bang for buck.</div>\n<div>After all, if you&#8217;re going to pay for something then you want it to do what it should and in a truly awesome way. And we promise, hand on our hearts, that this lot provides all that and more.</div>\n<div>One thing we think is really important to point out.

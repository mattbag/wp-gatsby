And yes, as the internet meme goes &#8211; We&#8217;d stop buying so many &#8211; but we are not quitters! And we know you&#8217;re not either.<br />\nWe know you LOVE beauty. Us too. We&#8217;re mad for it. But even we don&#8217;t want to work through that many products, tips and treatments before we know what&#8217;s worth looking at and, conversely, what to avoid at all costs.<br />\nThat brings us to <strong>The Beauty Insider&#8217;s official Top 10.</strong><br />\nThis is a list of what we regard as the best new products on counter right this very second.<br />\nHow do we know these are the very best of the best? <strong>Because we have tried and tested every single one.</strong> We&#8217;ve looked at texture, scent, efficacy and of course, bang for buck.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2821 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06215302/JPG-Armani-Blush-278x300.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06215302/JPG-Armani-Blush-278x300.jpg 278w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06215302/JPG-Armani-Blush.jpg 594w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" />\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s pretty right? Hop on over to our <a href="http://the-beautyinsider.com/top_10/august-top-10/">August Top 10</a> to find out what it is, what it does and why you NEEEEED it.</strong></p>\n<p>After all, if you&#8217;re going to pay for something then you want it to do what it should and in a truly awesome way. And we promise, hand on our hearts, that this lot provides all that and more.<br />\nOne thing we think is really important to point out. <strong>Not ONE, nope, NOT ONE, of the beauty houses behind these products has paid to be included on this list. It is 100 per cent independently reviewed by us &#8211; end of story.</strong><br />\nYou&#8217;re a beauty lover (you wouldn&#8217;t be here otherwise) and likely to have your own ideas about what really works and what doesn&#8217;t and even why. If there&#8217;s a product you absolutely adore, please let us know about it.<br />\nWho knows &#8211; perhaps we&#8217;ll love it just as much and it will make next month&#8217;s list.<br />\nBut here&#8217;s to the <a href="http://the-beautyinsider.com/top_10/august-top-10/">August Top 10 </a>&#8211; we just know you&#8217;re going to be friends.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06221725/JPG-Mecca-shiny-eyes.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"top10",name:"Top 10"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"5baf6a00-7517-59ab-ae9a-6881bded7ba4"}}}});

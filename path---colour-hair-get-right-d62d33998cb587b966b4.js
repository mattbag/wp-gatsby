Despite those limitations my desire to be blonde never truly eased and so when I scraped together enough cash to purchase a home hair dye I did so &#8211; immediately. </span><span class="s1">Unfortunately, said vibrant gold colour only turned my naturally auburn hair a freakishly unnatural fuchsia &#8211; forehead and tips of ears too. That was it for me and hair colour &#8211; particularly of the home variety.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But home hair colour has been completely revolutionised in recent years with incredible advances being made in both colour, formula, duration of results &#8211; even fragrance. Many contain nourishing ingredients so that your hair is in better condition after colouring than before. Plus, the new formulations (they now come in easy-to-handle foam and also gel) are easy to apply, provide all-over colour and don’t ruin your brand new towels. Hurrah!</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might not get a salon result, but even professional hair colourists will admit you’ll get pretty darn close, especially, if you follow a few simple rules. </span><span class="s1">Don’t attempt to attempt to take your hair colour lighter or darker by more than one shade. </span><span class="s1">This will ensure that your colour looks (and feels) 100 per cent natural, says John Frieda creative colour director Nicola Clarke. </span><span class="s1">Do talk to your hairstylist and ask for advice. He or she will be able to point you in the right direction in terms of brands and more importantly, shades that truly suit you. “A good stylist will help you choose a home products that’s as close as possible to what the salon would choose for you,” says Aleks Abadia, of Esstudio Galleria in Sydney.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Follow the instructions on the packet. Sounds simple, but it’s something that many of us neglect to do. </span><span class="s1">If the instructions suggest a 15 to 20 minute application then do that. Increasing or decreasing will affect your colour, but likely not in the way you had planned. </span><span class="s1">Test a small amount of dye on an area of skin and also a lock of hair before you take the plunge. This will indicate the exact result you can expect and also, reveal any allergies or issues that may arise. </span></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Cool Colour Stuff</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cover Your Grey Hair Colour Touch Up Chubby in Dark Brown, $22.95. 1800 251 215 or datelinecity.com This temporary touch up crayon-style colour is dead easy to use.

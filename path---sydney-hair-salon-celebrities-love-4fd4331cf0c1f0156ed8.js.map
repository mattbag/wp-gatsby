My aunt owned a hairdressing salon so I guess it’s in my blood. I always had a fascination with fashion, the beauty industry and the art of transformation. Science does how ever have its uses and I guess that&#8217;s why I was always so interested in the colouring process, mixing custom colours involves science, just without having to wear a white lab coat.</p>\\n<p><strong>Worst Gig</strong>:<br />\\nI worked as the bell boy in a<strong> very plush Sydney hotel</strong> in the early 80&#8217;s. Whilst the work was not really me, I had many celebrity encounters, witnessed some hair-raising behaviour, learned the art of discretion and got up close and personal with my<strong> idol Gianni Versace.</strong></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1251\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26160606/GeorgeGiavis-212x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"212\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26160606/GeorgeGiavis-212x300.jpg 212w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26160606/GeorgeGiavis-768x1087.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26160606/GeorgeGiavis-723x1024.jpg 723w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26160606/GeorgeGiavis.jpg 1239w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px\\\" /><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1256\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26162033/i-019349-radiance-perfected-tinted-moisturiser-no1-alabasta-1-940-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26162033/i-019349-radiance-perfected-tinted-moisturiser-no1-alabasta-1-940-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26162033/i-019349-radiance-perfected-tinted-moisturiser-no1-alabasta-1-940-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26162033/i-019349-radiance-perfected-tinted-moisturiser-no1-alabasta-1-940-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26162033/i-019349-radiance-perfected-tinted-moisturiser-no1-alabasta-1-940.jpg 940w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><em>The very handsome and frankly, ultra talented Mr George Giavis.

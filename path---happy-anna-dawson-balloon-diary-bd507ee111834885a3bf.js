You might know her. She&#8217;s that gorgeous, leggy brunette who appears in pics from exotic locations across the world always clutching a bright pink balloon.</p>\n<p>What you might not know is that this lovely young French-speaking woman <strong>is in fact an Aussie</strong>. Here, a few more fascinating insights into Anna and her honest-to-goodness inspirational life story.</p>\n<p><strong>Firstly, a little history about you Anna &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up in <strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>. Once I finished college, I started my own event- planning business, which took up of most of my 20’s. I was doing the work that I chose and ticking all the right boxes, but at some point I began to feel restless. I began to question what I was working towards and what I was actually saving for? I’d always <strong>dreamed of travelling and living in Paris</strong> but for me the idea of actually doing it seemed overwhelming. A few more years went by and when I turned 30 and that’s when I decided enough was enough. It was now or never so with no real plan and an optimistic attitude, <strong>I booked a ticket and moved to Paris</strong> and haven’t looked back!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2017" style="width: 238px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2017" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211029/Bath-JPG-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211029/Bath-JPG-238x300.jpg 238w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211029/Bath-JPG.jpg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@theballoondiary</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Then, a little history about The Balloon Diary &#8211; how did it come about and when and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Being on the other side of the world, I decided to create The Balloon Diary to share my life in Paris with friends and family back home in Australia. As for the idea of the actual balloon as simple as it sounds when you walk down a busy street in Paris with a pink balloon, people smile. It doesn’t matter if you don’t speak the same language, or if you have nothing in common with them at all – there’s still that moment where you share the joy of this tiny little thing that’s just a bit out of the ordinary. This little pink balloon has allowed me to connect with so many different people who would usually have just passed me by.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2020" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2020" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211335/Fragrance-JPG-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211335/Fragrance-JPG-300x222.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211335/Fragrance-JPG-768x568.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211335/Fragrance-JPG.jpg 809w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@theballoondiary</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>What does The Balloon Diary mean to you personally?</strong></p>\n<p>I used to be terrified of the unknown and constantly worrying about the future.

It gives you an instant lift and freshen up. I use it on my cheekbones, eyelids and down my nose.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2026" style="width: 168px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2026" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214623/HIGHLIGHTER-STICK_001CHAMP-bd-168x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214623/HIGHLIGHTER-STICK_001CHAMP-bd-168x300.jpg 168w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214623/HIGHLIGHTER-STICK_001CHAMP-bd-768x1369.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214623/HIGHLIGHTER-STICK_001CHAMP-bd-574x1024.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nude By Nature Touch of Glow Highlight Stick, $24.95.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Organic Coconut oil. I use it as a daily moisturiser, a weekly hair mask and every night to remove my eye make up. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n<p>3. Red lipstick. My favourite is <a href="https://www.priceline.com.au/bourjois-rouge-edition-velvet-8-ml">It&#8217;s Redding Men N° 18 from Bourjois</a>. It&#8217;s a matte liquid and lasts forever and doesn&#8217;t end up smudged all over my face.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2018" style="width: 238px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2018" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211201/montmarte-JPG-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211201/montmarte-JPG-238x300.jpg 238w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211201/montmarte-JPG.jpg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@theballoondiary</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Your favourite three beauty destinations &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>1. The Hammam at <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71185/Grande-Mosquee-de-Paris">The Mosquée de Paris </a>is my monthly ritual. Built in the 1920s not only is it beautiful but just so goddamn relaxing. If I’m not feeling good mentally may it be stress or I haven’t been sleeping well, I feel like it doesn’t matter how many layers I cake on, I still don’t like the way I look. The Hamman helps.</p>\n<p>2. Indian sun treatment at <a href="http://www.franckprovost.com.au">Frank Provost</a>. I love the look of having slightly sun kissed hair but living in Paris where the sun is not always shining makes it difficult to naturally create this look. Colour is applied by freehand painting and it works by lightening your natural colour making it very low maintenance.</p>\n<p>3. <a href="http://haussmann.galerieslafayette.com/en/">Galeries Lafayette</a> because it has EVERYTHING. I find myself popping in at least once a month. Sometimes I don&#8217;t have much time so I know I can get everything and anything I need whether it&#8217;s a manicure or beauty products.</p>\n<p><strong>Your top three beauty tips &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Always keep a red lipstick in your handbag.</strong> The perfect red lipstick can completely change your attitude and transform even the most boring outfit into something fun and sexy and prepare you for a last minute date or night out!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2024" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2024 size-medium" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214028/18959_xlarge-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214028/18959_xlarge-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214028/18959_xlarge-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19214028/18959_xlarge.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bourjois Rouge Edition Velvet in It&#8217;s Redding Men, $24.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>2.

Eyes or lips, but not both</strong>. Choose one feature that you want to highlight otherwise it can look too much.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/19211245/Blue-door-JPG.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"lifestyle",name:"Lifestyle"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"dbec0240-e6ff-5ed0-869a-285ff9671694"}}}});

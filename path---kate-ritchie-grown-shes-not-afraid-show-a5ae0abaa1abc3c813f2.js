She was a darling, chubby-cheeked little poppet who we simply adored &#8211; no matter what mischief she got up to, which frankly wasn&#8217;t much.</p>\n<p>Sally was a good girl. Which is why it&#8217;s kind of extraordinary to catch up with the actress who played her all those years ago and discover that she aint no kid any more. <strong>Indeed, Kate is all woman &#8211; and maybe then some</strong>.</p>\n<p>The woman has incredible hair that&#8217;s tousled and wild and dare we say it, sexy. Her eyes sparkle and she looks at you in a way that makes your knees buckle just that little bit. On top of that she&#8217;s clever and also, funny. She&#8217;s the legit full package.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3129" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3129" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09121216/Kate-Ritchie-JPG-300x294.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="294" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09121216/Kate-Ritchie-JPG-300x294.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09121216/Kate-Ritchie-JPG.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lady in red. Well, maroon anyway. Image: Instagram/@Kateritchie</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before you decide you hate her though, she&#8217;s also delightful. Yes, she&#8217;s warm and genuine and treats you like you&#8217;re her BFF and within about three minutes you find yourself wishing you were. But we&#8217;re not here for that &#8230; sadly.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re with the actress to talk all things hair and makeup and also, her latest gig as an ambassador for the intimate range Jockey.</p>\n<p>So here we go.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You&#8217;re a mama now but you look like a teen! How are you doing it?</strong></p>\n<p>A very tight ponytail!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does your daily skincare routine look like?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t think a skincare routine needs to be complicated and so I try to keep things simple. This includes having any products I use on a daily basis right there in front of me.</p>\n<p>Whether that be in the shower or front and centre on the vanity alongside my toothbrush serving as a constant reminder. I cleanse and moisturise morning and night and at this time of year I’m using the <a href="https://www.qvskincare.com.au/product/qv-face-nurturing-night-cream">QV Face Nurturing Night Cream</a> because my skin really needs it. I will exfoliate once a week and never leave the house without my moisturiser that contains an SPF and a tube of the <a href="https://www.qvskincare.com.au/products/face/eye-cream/">QV Face Revitalising Eye Cream</a> in my handbag because the air conditioning in the Nova studio (Kate co-hosts a radio show) can be a killer. There are other elements but these are the daily basics and they serve me well.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3127" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3127" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09000020/QV-JPG-300x256.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="256" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09000020/QV-JPG-300x256.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09000020/QV-JPG.jpg 367w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kate&#8217;s favourite night cream &#8211; perfect for those with dry skin.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Hair? Any time for hair? Lord knows I don’t. Did I say that out loud? Yes. Yes I did.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m blonder than usual at the moment so I really have to start lifting my haircare game. I must admit, I have been spoilt when it comes to hair over the years and it dates back to my days on set with Home and Away.</p>\n<p>I used to loathe having someone tell me what I could or couldn’t do with my hair or when I could have it cut and to what length. Now, I love that kind of direction! I met the super stylish and super talented Lilly Miljkovic in the makeup room during that period of my life and to this day she continues to cut, colour and style my hair. Right now we are Oribe obsessed..</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How did you get involved with this venture? Were you already familiar with the Jockey brand?</strong></p>\n<p>Of course. Jockey is a brand with a long history of greatness and I have had many pairs of their most comfortable knickers floating around my underwear drawer over the years. So when they approached me to be the ambassador for The Weekender range I was at first flattered and secondly eager to take on a role I hadn’t previously.</p>\n<p>I wanted to try something new, push my boundaries and fingers crossed &#8211; end up with a fresh, new Jockey underwear and loungewear cupboard!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you think Australian women are particularly beautiful and if so why? </strong></p>\n<p>Not necessarily. I find there are beautiful women the world over, Australia included. To me what makes them all beautiful is a shared sense of confidence in their own skin and an air of mystery.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Secret to your gorgeous glowing complexion is …</strong></p>\n<p>More sleep than alcohol. A healthy, restful mind. Plenty of hydration. And if all else fails &#8211; a bullet proof concealer.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3126" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08235002/170620_Jockey_05_2699-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><strong>Q: General beauty tip for women of all ages?</strong></p>\n<p>I have two. ‘Be happy’ closely followed by ‘Don’t pick your spots’.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When you look in the mirror you see …</strong></p>\n<p>A woman who should trust her judgement a little more.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: You plan to teach your little one what about women and beauty and body image?</strong></p>\n<p>That we can do anything. That we don’t need to make other women, or anyone for that matter, feel small in order to feel big/better/happier and that the most important thing we should strive to be is the best version of ourselves. No one else.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Underwear should be …</strong></p>\n<p>The correct size first and foremost and then I find I want my underwear to be the perfect mix of comfort and style and a little bit of luxe. My go-to underwear style is the Jockey Parisienne range. The cuts are so comfortable and flattering. The knickers have a two way stretch lace that moves with your body and the flat lace finish means they are perfect under any outfit.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Favourite outfit to wear out on the town?</strong></p>\n<p>I am a big fan of the silk shirt, they are a wonderful combination of classic style and sexiness. Teamed with a pair of hot boots and fabulous jewels you cannot go wrong. Oh, and Pants! Don’t forget your pants..</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When you get home the first thing you do is …</strong></p>\n<p>Cuddling my precious monkey is the only thing that stands in my way of taking a warm shower and changing into something more comfortable.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/08231114/170620_Jockey_06_2827.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"beauty-talk",name:"Beauty Talk"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"3c866045-cfa7-5bcf-8a93-61750fbe8af2"}}}});

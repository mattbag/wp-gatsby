Early in her sporting career, she was told she was too small &#8211; worse, too weak &#8211; to become a successful athlete.</p>\n<p>She could have given up right then and there. Instead, Victoria took that criticism and used it to fuel her inner fire. The rest, as they say, is history. A gold in 2008 at Beijing and another in 2012 in London.</p>\n<p>Today, as an ambassador for the Clinique Difference Maker campaign, she hopes to inspire women to stick to their goals regardless. Here, she shares a mojo tip or two, plus her thoughts on beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>Everyone has a dream. Yours is&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Never stop learning and challenging myself.</p>\n<p><strong>What impact do you hope to make?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope that my achievements, experiences and honesty can encourage women to just give things a try, to not let others dictate or decide what your limitations are, to know that doing your best is always good enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughts on failure?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe there’s value in every challenge, every difficulty and that with every failure something is gained. These experiences help you learn what you can withstand and what you’re capable of which brings confidence. That helps you to find your voice.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you stay motivated? How can we?</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t use the word motivated. I like to replace it with the more tangible, less mystical word commitment. That way it’s just a choice. You either do something or you don’t.</p>\n<p><strong>You want to feel confident about the way you look. You reach for&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>I love a little blush. Adding some colour to your cheeks makes you look healthy. Try Clinique Blusher Cream Stick, $43. clinique.com.au</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel makeup and skincare play an important part in a woman’s life?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve always enjoyed makeup and I love the way it can change the way I look and even the way I feel. It can enhance your appearance and boost your confidence, so I enjoy wearing it.</p>\n<p>The Clinique Difference Maker campaign is a global campaign designed to inspire confidence in women and empower them to make a difference. Clinique is also launching the Clinique Difference Initiative, a concept that will see the brand supporting various groups including Fitted For Work.</p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/19110941/STH12TAP1_397740k.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"lifestyle",name:"Lifestyle"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"415239ce-38d3-5490-bf82-f0ce10fb336a"}}}});

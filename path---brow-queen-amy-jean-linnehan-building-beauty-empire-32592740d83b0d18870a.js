These days switched-on women know they&#8217;re better off visiting with a brow pro at least semi-regularly, if not every couple of months. Because the truth is, a professional is always a good idea. That holds true no matter what you&#8217;re attempting to do &#8211; but most definitely when it comes to your face.</p>\n<p>In Australia, you have plenty of brow pros to choose from. But there&#8217;s one who truly stands out from the rest &#8211; Amy-Jean Linnehan, of the famed <a href="http://www.amyjean.com.au">Amy-Jean Eye Couture</a>. We&#8217;ve long admired AJ &#8211; both for her incredible brow skill and also, her business finesse. Here, we grilled her on both.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you get your start in the brow business?</strong><br />\nA total gamble really. I had no business plan but knew I could whizz a brow into shape. I set up in a very busy hair salon so I had no hesitation in chanting about eyebrows all day to the poor ladies waiting for their colour to process. I eventually got some bottoms on my brow bed and then before I knew it I was doing 11 hour days and 25 clients a day.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been a dead-set brow pervert and a keen artist. I studied business at uni and decided to have a go at combining my love for a well shaped brow and my curiosity on how to develop a brand. I honestly never thought, this might not work out. I was too busy on the tweezers to give it a seconds thought.</p>\n<p><strong>How many salons do you currently have?</strong><br />\nFive. One in Sydney, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Brisbane and Amy Jean Privée VIP suites which are also in Sydney.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2766" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2766" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172739/Versace-JPG-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172739/Versace-JPG-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172739/Versace-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172739/Versace-JPG.jpg 596w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">AJ&#8217;s Gold Coast Salon &#8211; LUXE.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Can you pass on any general brow advice or is it just too tricky?</strong><br />\nYes, shoot me! I could cough up pages of advice but really it&#8217;s far too general to give advice on such a uniquely framing feature of our face. The depth of colour, the facial features, your muscle strength symmetry, hair colour and skin tones all come into play.<br />\nI will say this &#8230; please invest in a visit to a specialist who has an acute eye for detail and follow their lead. This will be money well spent.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2763" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2763" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171104/Amy_Jean_at_Work_Melbourne-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171104/Amy_Jean_at_Work_Melbourne-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171104/Amy_Jean_at_Work_Melbourne-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171104/Amy_Jean_at_Work_Melbourne-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Making beautiful brows happen. AJ at work.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Finish this sentence. A beautifully-sculpted brow has the power to</strong> &#8230; shed years off your appearance. It creates polish and lift. An elegant brow will always turn heads.</p>\n<p><strong>And now this sentence. On the flip-side a poorly-shaped brow can</strong> &#8230; age you 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the most popular brow look right now?</strong><br />\nWhat suits YOU! Don&#8217;t follow trends. Be original. If your features are bold then you can carry a fierce brow, but you tiny gals out there with petite features and minute heads, an overdone brow will enter the room before you and overtake your whole presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Is that a style we can all wear/aspire to?</strong><br />\nThere&#8217;s plenty of hot celeb brows out there but they look great because they&#8217;re tailored to their individual look. Once again, invest in a trip to see a brow shaping guru.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2767" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2767" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172844/Dannii-JPG-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172844/Dannii-JPG-300x298.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172844/Dannii-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29172844/Dannii-JPG.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dannii Minogue &#8211; just one of AJ&#8217;s many famous clients.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You always look AMAZING. Give me three top beauty tips please &#8230;</strong><br />\nHa that&#8217;s kind. Guess I&#8217;ll stick to never leaving the house without a full face on then. Hang on, there&#8217;s one. I love makeup and I see it as artistic expression. I&#8217;d love to be a tinted moisturizer and lip gloss kinda girl, but I&#8217;d most likely scare my neighbors.<br />\nSo mine are:</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t be lazy with makeup</strong>. Put your best face forward every day. If you’re time poor then investigate semi permanent makeup. We offer lips, eyeliner and brow tattooing with extremely natural results.</p>\n<p><strong>Use quality skincare</strong> with active ingredients like C serums or retinol. I swear it burns a layer of crappy skin off each time you use it. I also marinate in <a href="https://www.dr-spiller.com.au/product/collagen-cream/">Dr Spiller Collagen Cream.</a></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2764 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171251/Collagen_Cream_Product-300x255.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="255" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171251/Collagen_Cream_Product-300x255.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171251/Collagen_Cream_Product-768x652.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29171251/Collagen_Cream_Product-1024x869.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Blow dries.</strong> Treat yourself. It feels like magic when you skip out of a salon with fresh locks. Go Hollywood and go big. Yes, accept the back-comb option I say.</p>\n<p><strong>What does your routine look like &#8211; manicure every Tuesday, blow dry every Thursday?</strong><br />\nI wish I had a rhythm like that! I travel a lot so that throws things into chaos. I tend to message my hairdresser the day I need help and he puts up with me for some reason. We&#8217;re all bloody time poor aren&#8217;t we?</p>\n<p>I just bought a home spray tan gun after my fiancée agreed to be my tan man.

We know them. We are them! They make for great business owners because &#8230;</strong><br />\nWe&#8217;re intuitive. We know how to support each other and listen to others needs yet we won&#8217;t be played and we know how to protect what we&#8217;ve worked hard for by recognizing when someone/something isn&#8217;t genuine.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any advice for women wanting to launch a new business or grow the one they already have?</strong><br />\nYes it&#8217;s called head down tail up. If you&#8217;re not a fan of sheer hard work then reconsider. If you love a crazy day (for example, me responding to this interview at 11:56pm) then go for it!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for challenges, projects and gambles. If I finish one project, I&#8217;m always thinking about not only the next one but the next two. The ideas are always brewing.</p>\n<p>We have 26 on the Amy Jean Eye Couture team now so there&#8217;s developments by the minute. You cannot sit still in business. It&#8217;s a race. But a word of advice &#8211; be thorough and never cut corners.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2771" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2771" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29173316/AJ-Roxy-JPG-242x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29173316/AJ-Roxy-JPG-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29173316/AJ-Roxy-JPG.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">AJ&#8217;s famous clients often appear on her Instagram @amyjeaneyecouture</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Practical tips of any kind? Instagram, a good PR agent, a solid support team?</strong><br />\nFor me it&#8217;s my staff. My clients always tell me how lovely and kind each of my team are and that&#8217;s because I hunt down kind-hearted people in my interview process. Ego can stay outside. I learnt very early on that one self-entitled personality can throw the whole team out which means no more working as a &#8216;collective&#8217;. A great team means everyone can go home with a happy heart.</p>\n<p><b>Most famous clients?</b></p>\n<p>Naomi Campbell, Courtney Love, Dannii Minogue and Delta Goodrem (and of course you Miss TBI). Honestly, my most fabulous and fun clients are always, without a doubt, journalists or anyone who works in magazines.</p>\n<p><strong>Any downsides to being a woman in business?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m learning every day. There&#8217;s times when I do tell myself to &#8216;man up&#8217;. I loathe the word boss and I&#8217;m always hopeful that my staff will show me respect and work hard because I show them respect and work hard. I like to think those two aspects are mirrored without the need to ask for it.<br />\nIt can be tough though &#8230; I cried the first time I fired someone. She cried first. I cried because she was crying. Then we cuddled each other crying. Hopeless.</p>\n<p><strong>Future you &#8211; do you have a five year plan or a dream for the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; I&#8217;ve got my biggest business project yet just around the corner and I am so flipping excited! Then I&#8217;ll get bored again and chase another project. I plan everything while I&#8217;m wide awake at 2am, including salon interiors for shops that aren&#8217;t mine yet. But I&#8217;ve just been stalking them on Realestate.com so I can keep myself awake. Crazy fool I am.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2769" style="width: 239px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2769" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29173102/ring-JPG-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29173102/ring-JPG-239x300.jpg 239w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/29173102/ring-JPG.jpg 475w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yes.

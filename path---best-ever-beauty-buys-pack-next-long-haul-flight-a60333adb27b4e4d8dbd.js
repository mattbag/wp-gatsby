From cabin air, the foods we eat, general travel stress and sleep deprivation. It’s no wonder we exit from customs looking far from fresh. But there are some simple tips we can try to keep the glow in our skin after our flight.”</p>\n<p><strong>Tracey’s tips for long-haul flights include:</strong></p>\n<p>Upgrade your moisturiser to a richer cream for longer flights as well as a good hydration serum. Add sparingly a small amount of your favourite hydration mask around the eye area to help last the distance of your flight and keep those fine lines exaggerated by dehydration away.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2648 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-242x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-768x952.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21231120/BS-GROUPED-SHOT-bd-826x1024.jpg 826w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" />\n<p>We like a little <a href="https://www.priceline.com.au/freezeframe-boost-serum-12-ml">Freezeframe Boost Serum, $59</a>. Feels awesome and makes skin fresh and glowing and (bonus!) firm.</p>\n<p>Try to avoid the above air nozzle blasting directly on our face by turning it slightly to an angle away from the face and on a low setting. This will also help overcome dry, sore eyes which also make us look and feel worse.</p>\n<p>Opt for a herbal tea or plain water – your skin will thank you for it when you land. If you really must drink to celebrate your holiday ahead with friends, increase your water intake or keep it to just one glass.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2652 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21232720/JPG-beauty-chef-176x300.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21232720/JPG-beauty-chef-176x300.jpg 176w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21232720/JPG-beauty-chef.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" />\n<p>Add a dash (or three) of <a href="https://thebeautychef.com/products/hydration-inner-beauty-boost">The Beauty Chef Hydration Inner Beauty Boost, $39.95.</a></p>\n<p>Although not as big a risk of being in a car due to the size of windows, it’s best to apply sunscreen if you’re positioned in a window seat. Windows on planes do not block UVA rays associated with wrinkling and skin ageing. The dose of UVA is also much stronger at 20,000 feet. Apply a good protective daily moisturizer 50+ or block out before your flight that will last up to 24 hours as a safe measure. Close the window blind to avoid the sun’s rays when permitted.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2643 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-120x300.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-120x300.jpg 120w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-768x1920.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd-410x1024.jpg 410w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230531/SunActive-Mineral-Defence-Face-Body-Lotion-90ml-HR-bd.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px" />\n<p><a href="http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/en/davidjones/sunactive-spf-50-mineral-defence--face---body-xop">Ultraceuticals SunActive SPF50+ Mineral Defence Face &amp; Body Lotion, $59.</a></p>\n<p>Keep the under-eye area well hydrated with a good hydration serum or energising hydration mask by dotting sparingly around the eye area. Use a balancing mist hydration spray also throughout the flight to keep your thirsty skin plump with hydration.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2644 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230638/6810_Jurlique_RosewaterMist_Group_RGB-copy-bd1-246x300.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230638/6810_Jurlique_RosewaterMist_Group_RGB-copy-bd1-246x300.jpg 246w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230638/6810_Jurlique_RosewaterMist_Group_RGB-copy-bd1-768x935.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/21230638/6810_Jurlique_RosewaterMist_Group_RGB-copy-bd1-841x1024.jpg 841w" sizes="(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px" />\n<p><a href="http://www.jurlique.com.au/rosewater-b-mist-int-6-200ml">Jurlique Rosewater Balancing Mist Intense Deluxe Edition, $79</a> &#8211; so ace it made our <a href="http://the-beautyinsider.com/top10/">July Top 10.</a></p>\n<p>Remember to keep your beauty essential liquids under 100ml when packing your carry-on luggage.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re there, like we said earlier, <strong>SUNSCREEN</strong>!

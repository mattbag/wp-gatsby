It hydrates (obviously) but also promotes a radiant, more youthful complexion. Swoon.</p>\n<p>The formula combines black rose with may rose and alpine rose extracts meaning it leaves skin feeling utterly amazing and, thanks to rose essential oil combined with magnolia and geranium, gives off a delicate floral scent. Sexy, sophisticated and super luxe. Be prepared to look lovely and perhaps, attract an admirer or three while you&#8217;re at it. <strong>Available from July 23.</strong></p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/03213524/Sisley-Black-Rose-Infusion-Cream-packshot-bd.jpg"},categories:[19]}},pathContext:{id:"d15e7239-538d-5040-b564-75e0bb6ba720"}}}});

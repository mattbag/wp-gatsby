The pair, who were married from 2006 to 2012, received an extraordinary amount of attention wherever they went.

Katie has continued acting and has also taken on some directing projects of late. She&#8217;s also been quietly dating actor and comedian <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Jamie Foxx</a> for roughly three years. Didn&#8217;t know that? Like we said, she likes to keep her private life private and high fives to that.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1534" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12203256/Katie-Holmes-Sella-Bag-Stucco-3.29.17-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12203256/Katie-Holmes-Sella-Bag-Stucco-3.29.17-200x300.jpg 200w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12203256/Katie-Holmes-Sella-Bag-Stucco-3.29.17-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12203256/Katie-Holmes-Sella-Bag-Stucco-3.29.17-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />\n<p><strong><em>Yep.

No social media tit for tat for this woman. Anyway, we&#8217;re not here to talk about that. Unless you want us to in which case reach out.

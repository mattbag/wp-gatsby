Together, we&#8217;re going to sort the facts from the fiction. Ready? here we go.</p>\n<p><strong>Muscle Freezers</strong></p>\n<p>Muscle freezing treatments such as Botox and Dysport vary in cost from $10 to $20 or more a unit. Smoothing lines on the forehead will require roughly 10 to 20 units. Treating ‘crow’s feet’, the lines at the outside corners of the eyes, will take about the same amount.<br />\nAsk for an estimated price before you commit.<br />\nBotox and Dysport are brand names only. The two products differ with many practitioners selling Dysport for less, but using more of it. Some clients get longer-lasting results with one brand and therefore tend to stick with it. Ask your practitioner which brand they prefer and also why.<br />\nRemember also that while they are minor, there are risks involved. Incorrect needle placement can see the wrong muscles relaxed, which can cause eye droop. And it&#8217;s not pretty.</p>\n<p>This has never happened to us here at The Beauty Insider and that&#8217;s with a good decade of muscle freezing treatments. And it is very, very rare. That said, it HAS happened to plenty of our closest girlfriends. If it does happen to you, you can take comfort in the fact that the treatment only lasts about three months so you will not have to suffer forever.</p>\n<p>Further, a good cosmetic doctor may be able to place other injections in other areas in order to lessen the effect.</p>\n<p>Our verdict on the whole? This is a terrific treatment that we have no trouble recommending. That said, be careful who does the work for you. You want to look fresh, not frozen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2414" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2414" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24212037/nurianieva-JPG-279x300.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24212037/nurianieva-JPG-279x300.jpg 279w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24212037/nurianieva-JPG.jpg 476w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@nurianieva &#8211; fresh, fresh, not frozen.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Fillers</strong></p>\n<p>Fillers cost considerably more than muscle freezers, but you require considerably less of the product itself. One ampoule would resolve lines around the mouth for example. A single ampoule will cost about $500 to $600. Many clinics offer a full-face treatment for roughly $1500.<br />\nThe costs will vary greatly depending on how much product you opt for, and which brand your practitioner uses.<br />\nAgain, ask which brand is being used and why. Also, inquire about possible bruising and other potential side effects.</p>\n<p>Many fillers come with a numbing ingredient such as Lidocaine meaning that the area will become numb after the first injection. This will help to lessen any discomfort. You can also try ice or an anti-anxiety tablet such as Valium or Xanax if your doctor is able to provide these.</p>\n<p>Finally, some practitioners offer &#8216;laughing&#8217; gas in order to take the edge off. On the whole though this is a very tolerable treatment. The one area it can be quite painful is the lips. If you&#8217;re after a full pout and are planning on getting filler injected in this area we recommend a dental block beforehand.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tried with and without and can report that with a dental block is way more enjoyable!</p>\n<p>Our verdict on fillers? They&#8217;re an excellent way to provide volume to areas of the face that have lost fat due to age and also, areas of the face you&#8217;d like to enhance such as your mouth and also, your cheekbones.</p>\n<p>Again, we recommend a little, not a lot. You want to look like you, only enhanced, says <a href="http://allsaintsskinclinic.com.au">natural beauty specialist Dr Joseph Hkeik.</a></p>\n<p><strong>One Last Word &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Risks of both types of treatment will be minimised if you opt for a practitioner who is a qualified medical doctor or is supervised by one. It’s also a good idea to see someone who has a reputation for being a skilled injectable specialist rather than someone who dabbles in injectables on the side.<br />\nBeware of anyone who advertises or discounts heavily, advises <a href="http://drvanpark.com.au">cosmetic specialist Dr Van Park</a>.<br />\n“There’s a reason they have to do that,” says Dr Park, who believes word of mouth is the best advertising there is.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/24211238/KimmyK-Kylie-JPG.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"fc6dd94c-1439-5aa4-8293-6cbf23b33a54"}}}});

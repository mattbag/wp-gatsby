It is small enough to reach hard-to-cleanse areas like the nose, but also covers large areas of the face. It is made of quick-drying and non-porous silicone to prevent bacteria build up, and features 8000 pulsations per minute for deep and effective cleansing. Did you get all that? Basically, it&#8217;s a cleansing tool and it&#8217;s ace. We&#8217;ve been using it for months and our skin has never looked better.</p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/27200754/LUNA_play_plus_AQUAMARINE_front_shadow-bd.jpg"},categories:[17]}},pathContext:{id:"3f621027-ba9d-5b69-91ea-f631646d4233"}}}});

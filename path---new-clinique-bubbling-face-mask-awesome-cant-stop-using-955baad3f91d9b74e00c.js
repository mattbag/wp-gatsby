I am straight up obsessed with face masks.</p>\n<p>Quite simply, I adore face mask of all types and am regularly found tucked up in my bathroom testing brand new versions out on my very own face. Because hey &#8211; if I&#8217;m going to say it&#8217;s worth buying (or, conversely, that it isn&#8217;t) then I need to know that for a fact. And the only way to know that is to give said face mask a test run.</p>\n<p>This week I gave <a href="http://www.clinique.com.au/product/4323/45672/just-arrived/pep-start-bubble-mask">Clinique&#8217;s Pep-Start Bubble Mask, $52</a>, a whirl and damn if I didn&#8217;t LOVE it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3397" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3397" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10211752/JPG-Me-Mask-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10211752/JPG-Me-Mask-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10211752/JPG-Me-Mask-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10211752/JPG-Me-Mask.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">All the bubbles, all the glow and in just two minutes. #WINNING</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a few reasons for that. Yes, it&#8217;s pink and yes, it bubbles in a cool, tingly way. While bubbling it sucks out dirt and grime and other nasties and leaves skin clean, yet soft and also super smooth.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, it takes just two minutes and once removed (it washes off easily with a splash or three of water) my skin has a gorgeous glow that just cannot be denied. You can see it immediately after you use the mask and during the days following.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3398" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10212241/JPG-Adore-Clinique-142x300.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10212241/JPG-Adore-Clinique-142x300.jpg 142w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10212241/JPG-Adore-Clinique.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" />\n<p>Me? I am sold. Did I receive a cent for saying so? No. I just really REALLY like it.</p>\n<p>My advice &#8211; try it and ASAP.</p>\n<p>Oh, one last thing &#8230; you can&#8217;t really use it ALL the time, even though it&#8217;s tempting. This mask works best if used two to three times a week. And don&#8217;t panic. There are other masks you can safely use on the other days. Phew!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13234334/JPG-Clinique-Insta.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"8ca1dccb-1395-5512-a83f-8c78ec052c9c"}}}});

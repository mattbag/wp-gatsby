That is, until we learn better. Here, at The Beauty Insider, we are all about beauty that springs from the heart.</p>\n<p>Sure, it sounds naff. And it may not land you a cosmetics contract. <strong>But beauty that starts at the soul is more important, more impactful and more moving than anything else can be.</strong></p>\n<p>Given that’s our belief we set about finding women who we feel fit into this category &#8211; that is women who truly embody our idea of beauty. Once we found them, and truthfully, it wasn’t hard &#8211; they’re everywhere, we asked them to supply their own personal photographs from important stages of their lives and to discuss openly and honestly how they felt then about their beauty &#8211; and where they’re at today.</p>\n<h1>Sarah Humphries &#8211; founder of SHA PR</h1>\n<p>The award-winning public relations company has gone from strength to strength in recent years. Despite her success, Sarah remains as down-to-earth and adorable as she’s always been.</p>\n<p>Here, she talks candidly about her feelings about beauty and what she sees in the mirror each day.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-463 alignleft" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120547/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-1-300x268.png" alt="sarah-humphries-pic-1" width="300" height="268" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120547/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-1-300x268.png 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120547/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-1.png 509w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Age : 24.</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Location : London.</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Scene:</strong> I had been living in London for three and a half years and this was taken at a friend&#8217;s 30th birthday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>When I looked in the mirror I saw &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">A pretty average/normal looking girl.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I would tell myself that &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">If I worked out more at the gym I would look better.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My favourite feature was &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Eyes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The thing I gave myself the hardest time over &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">What I thought was bad skin and flabby belly. I&#8217;m not entirely sure, because when I look back I see neither, but man, at the time it was my on-going conversation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My skincare routine consisted of &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I think I discovered Estee Lauder&#8217;s Advanced Night Repair around this time. I was discovering eye creams (prevention is better than cure) and looking at harder skincare products like Jan Marini.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My makeup was all about &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Fresh skin, liquid liner and glossy lips.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Going out hair meant &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Straight. I discovered Japanese straightening.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>If I could have changed anything about myself it would have been &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">The flabby belly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My beauty role model was &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m not sure I can remember. I mean anyone who has fresh skin and knew how to do their hair was pretty impressive to me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>On the whole I felt …</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I think pretty ok. Sure some insecurities, but overall I was in a pretty good place. I was at the gym, having fun, not feeling too bad about myself or life.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-464 alignleft" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120600/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-2-300x300.png" alt="sarah-humphries-pic-2" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120600/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-2-300x300.png 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120600/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-2-150x150.png 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120600/Sarah-Humphries-Pic-2.png 601w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Age : 34</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Location: Sydney.</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">The Scene: This is with my son, Myles, who was 5 months old in the photo. I have Wednesdays off work, which is when this photo was taken.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>When I look at myself I see &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">A mum.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I tell myself that &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m not doing too bad, given the lack of sleep.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My favourite feature now &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Still my eyes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Growing up is challenging in that it&#8217;s &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Realising that I&#8217;m actually a grown up is the hardest thing of all. I still feel young, but have to realise that I&#8217;m probably not.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The best thing about being my age is &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">I have less hangovers now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My skincare routine consists of &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Double cleanse, micellar water, Advanced Night Repair (still), day or night moisturiser and the odd mask.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My makeup look is &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Barely there. Since having my son I don&#8217;t even wear mascara. I actually feel I look younger and fresher without it</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Great hair means hair that&#8217;s &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Washed and straightened.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t have the power to change anything about myself because now I &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Well, I don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;m just glad you can look at a photo of me 10 years ago and a photo now and still know its the same person.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My beauty role model is &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Anyone who can get out the door in 15 minutes and still look chic.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>On the whole I feel …</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">Pretty proud of myself. I have a reasonable amount on my plate and I still find time to straighten my hair.

I was wearing a pink Chinese pyjama top, all the rage.</p>\n<p><strong>When I looked in the mirror I saw &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>A bit of a babe. I got quite a bit of attention from young guys, so I knew I wasn’t bad looking.</p>\n<p><strong>I would tell myself that &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>the boy I liked would eventually find me irresistible (he did, but by then I wasn’t that keen anymore)</p>\n<p><strong>My favourite feature was &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>My eyes</p>\n<p><strong>The thing I gave myself the hardest time over &#8230; and why.</strong></p>\n<p>The mono brow and the moustache!

You think you have something worked out and then it turns out to be not what you expected, or has become something else. I am thinking about expectations, about jobs and relationships mostly.</p>\n<p><strong>The best thing about being my age is &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Having the experience not to care so much about trivial things. Not sweating the small stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>My skincare routine consists of &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Always cleansing and moisturising before bed. And using sunscreen. Every single day.</p>\n<p><strong>My makeup look is &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Minimal; a nice BB or CC cream, then some eyeliner, understated lips and some blush.</p>\n<p><strong>Great hair means hair that&#8217;s …</strong></p>\n<p>Long enough to be able to wear out or up, without looking like an old hippy.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t have the power to change anything about myself because now I &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Am not super critical of myself. Sure, I don’t like ageing but I feel if I had started down the path of being obsessive about it, it would have made me too self-absorbed.</p>\n<p><strong>My beauty role model is &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Jamie Lee Curtis because she is very natural looking and strong. She is still really beautiful but not in a Hollywood, over-worked, neurotic way.</p>\n<p>On the whole I feel I feel quite strong and fit. I watch what I eat and I exercise. The main focus for me now is health rather than physical beauty. My body allows me to do lots of things I love, like jogging, riding and swimming. I want to look after it so I can continue doing those things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/13120608/Sarah-Humphries.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"beauty-talk",name:"Beauty Talk"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"d5d15f26-daae-5445-b3bf-6e880d04cece"}}}});

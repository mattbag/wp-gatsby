But we weren&#8217;t too sure what that ought to look like. So we went to a woman who we knew would be able to provide the answers and fast.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s the deal. According to <strong>Iman Davamoni</strong>, founder of the manicure service <a href="https://www.purelypolished.com.au">Purely Polished</a>, nails today should be classic and simple, which means round or oval shaped.</p>\n<p>These shapes are easy to maintain  between manicures and are practical when it comes to modern-day life activities such as typing on a keyboard or tapping on that smart phone of yours. <strong>The shape they should never be &#8211; square.</strong></p>\n<figure id="attachment_1935" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1935" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203828/PP-mug-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203828/PP-mug-300x298.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203828/PP-mug-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203828/PP-mug.jpg 596w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@purelypolished</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&#8220;The square nail just isn&#8217;t practical,&#8221; explains Iman.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to easy to break and it can catch on clothes as well as getting in the way when typing phones or laptops.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So there you go. Square is out.</p>\n<p>As far as shades are concerned, the top three choices for both fingers and toes are:</p>\n<p>Nudes &#8211; Iman recommends <a href="http://faby.com.au/sensual-touch-15ml/">Sensual Touch from Faby.</a></p>\n<p>Greys &#8211; Her clients most often ask for <a href="http://www.paintnaillacquer.com.au/product-page/mint-sorbet">Amazon Haze from Paint Nail Lacquer</a>.</p>\n<p>Deep Burgundy Reds &#8211; In this colour family Iman likes <a href="http://faby.com.au/rouge-fonce-15ml/">Rouge Fonce from Faby</a> and <a href="http://www.paintnaillacquer.com.au/product-page/copy-of-copy-of-copper-blush">Lady Voodoo from Paint Nail Lacquer.</a></p>\n<figure id="attachment_1933" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1933" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203709/PP--300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203709/PP--300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203709/PP--150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203709/PP-.jpg 596w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@purelypolished</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If the top three don&#8217;t do it for you and you&#8217;re more a pastel kind of a chick, don&#8217;t panic.</p>\n<p><strong>Iman says that pastels are still very popular</strong>, in particular <a href="http://www.paintnaillacquer.com.au/product-page/lady-voodoo">Paint Nail Lacquer in Pale Glacier.</a></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-1939 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09211133/glacier--168x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09211133/glacier--168x300.jpg 168w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09211133/glacier-.jpg 233w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" />\n<p>Finally, why get a manicure at all? Firstly, nails need care. But there&#8217;s more to a mani (and a pedi) than that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dedicated ‘me’ time,&#8221; explains Iman.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can put down your phone and enforce ‘time out’ as part of your self-care routine. <span lang="EN-US">Massages (which are an integral part of mani-pedis), improve circulation and stimulate blood flow which reduces stress on your hands. </span>Also, well maintained nails enhance professionalism, which can translate to a huge boost in confidence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just make sure they&#8217;re not square!</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09203744/PP-BW-.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"926a2453-0595-5b35-9a5e-4eca41fcc01f"}}}});

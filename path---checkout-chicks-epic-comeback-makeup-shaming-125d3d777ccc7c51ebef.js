The only positive here is that an angry Kerry wrote a powerful response on Facebook and now that message is going viral.</p>\n<p>In that post Kerry explained exactly what went down which was that a complete stranger laughed about her makeup and made vicious comments to a teenager who looked to be her daughter. Kerry says the comments went something like this: <strong>&#8220;Have you seen the state on that?</strong> Who comes to work to sit on a checkout looking like that &#8230; I don&#8217;t know who she thinks she is&#8221;. These deeply hurtful remarks were interspersed with some sharp glances and loud laughter &#8211; nice.</p>\n<p>Thankfully Kerry has a fierce streak and instead of hiding in the lunch room in tears she hopped onto Facebook and gave the woman and the teen a solid schooling in good manners and also the fact that makeup is meant to <strong>be a form of self-expression and fun for the person WEARING it</strong> &#8211; not the random strangers he or she might stumble across throughout the day or night.</p>\n<p>&#8220;1st of all: Why would you find that acceptable? I&#8217;m not harming nobody (sic),&#8221; Kerry wrote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Would you say the same about a girl who has a problem with her skin and spots on her face? I doubt it. 2nd: Why don&#8217;t you lead by example to your daughter about empowering other women rather than tearing them down. In this society the last thing we need to be doing to each other as humans is judging people based on looks.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2073" style="width: 211px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2073" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/21154817/Facebook-post-JPG-211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/21154817/Facebook-post-JPG-211x300.jpg 211w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/21154817/Facebook-post-JPG.jpg 661w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The post by Kerry Whittaker. Image: Facebook.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The newspaper Metro UK reported that the post was shared many thousands of times and liked even more. However, it has since been deleted and Kerry&#8217;s account has been blocked. We&#8217;ve no idea why.</p>\n<p>Hopefully though other people will continue to share the message she posted and perhaps also reconsider before they criticise someone else&#8217;s looks <strong>(or someone else&#8217;s anything for that matter)</strong>. And if you are going to say something hurtful our advice is to not pick Kerry as your victim because she clearly she&#8217;s well capable of giving you a serious burn. Don&#8217;t believe us? Here&#8217;s her final remark.</p>\n<p>&#8220;3rd: When you can do a cut crease as sick as this then come back to me and tell me I look like S*&amp;T.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Go Kerry. We&#8217;re with you all the way.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/21155430/Makeup-shame-JPG.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"b706d207-edbc-5043-ae10-8b420a5adb4c"}}}});

But if you happen to have a man in your life, you might like to treat him as well. After all, he likely deserves a bit of a pamper session too.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2391 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18190454/Beard-Balm-JPG-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18190454/Beard-Balm-JPG-300x244.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18190454/Beard-Balm-JPG.jpg 685w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><strong>We love <a href="https://www.gentsac.com.au/product/booze-and-baccy-beard-balm/">Captain Fawcett Booze and Baccy Beard Balm, $35.</a> Your man will too. Him only though okay? </strong></p>\n<p>The good news here is that there are a vast array of skincare products that are perfectly suitable for both you and your man.<br />\nYes, his skin will differ to yours, but probably not dramatically &#8211; <strong>despite what the marketers would have you believe</strong>. The truth is that most products are suitable for both men and women. It&#8217;s just that the fellas tend to be drawn to more masculine packaging, dark shades, strong lines and so on and so brands give them what they desire.</p>\n<p>The products inside however are largely identical, if slightly more masculine as far as scent is concerned.<br />\nSo, back to the blokes and their needs.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2367" style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2367" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18164934/glasses-JPG-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18164934/glasses-JPG-298x300.jpg 298w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18164934/glasses-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18164934/glasses-JPG.jpg 594w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@damienwoolnough</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Dapper man about town Damien Woolnough was born handsome! Still, he takes good care of his skin &#8211; obviously.</strong></p>\n<p>Your man will likely shave regularly, which means his skin may be more coarse to the touch and also possibly irritated and/or inflamed from time to time. He may also suffer the occasional ingrown hair, something you may be familiar with &#8211; only not on your face.<br />\nOther than that however, your fella’s skin isn’t that different to yours. So if you have similar skin types (you’re either oily, combination or dry) you can utilise the same skincare products, save yourself some time and money and maybe even enjoy a moment of relaxation together. <strong>Win win WIN!</strong><br />\nOf course there are some products you won’t want to share. Any creams or moisturisers etc that come in a pot should be one person only &#8211; you don’t want someone else’s fingers in your moisturiser no matter how much you adore them! Pump packs are suitable for all, however.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2368 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18165617/cool-fix-JPG-170x300.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18165617/cool-fix-JPG-170x300.jpg 170w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18165617/cool-fix-JPG.jpg 315w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" />\n<p><strong>Manly men like many gear &#8211; your fella will love</strong> <a href="https://www.gentsac.com.au/product/the-cool-fix/">Anthony The Cool Fix, $59</a>. It calms skin and cools razor burn and works to prevent razor bumps and also ingrown hairs. Yay.<br />\nYour guy will also want to use his own razor and possibly shave gel. If he does suffer from in-grown hairs or teeny bumps due to shaving, he might like to try a product that minimises redness and irritation after every shave.<br />\nBut that favourite fragrance that you love so much? Well, that’s for you and you only. Hands off boys!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18164307/suit-JPG.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"lifestyle",name:"Lifestyle"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"64448a42-aee8-5219-83c9-9a6415a4d5d4"}}}});

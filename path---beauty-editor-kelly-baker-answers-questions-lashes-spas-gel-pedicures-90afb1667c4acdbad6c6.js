Like, what&#8217;s your favourite mascara, is your job as incredible as it looks, how do I get rid of dark circles? I figured the quickest way to answer the questions I hear the most, is to pop them down in one hit.</p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s a handful of Qs I do get asked a lot and, conveniently enough, a handful of answers to go with them.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been a beauty editor for a long time. How did you get your start?</strong><br />\nI started as a hard news reporter and even though I loved the frantic pace of it I knew it wasn’t for me. I wanted to be more poetic in my writing style and car crashes and council meeting follow-ups don’t allow for much of that!</p>\n<p><strong>How would you describe your personal style?</strong><br />\nI’m a little bit rock chick I would think. I tend to wear not too much makeup at all. But I love a luminescent cheek and a berry stained mouth. Natural and fresh I would think … Who knows? It’s very hard to assess yourself realistically .. I might have to ask around &#8230; Maybe you guys could tell me? Actually &#8230; only if you&#8217;re going to be kind. I&#8217;m more sensitive than I look!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2688" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2688" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010640/10458555_10153046364954616_1427293804678173831_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010640/10458555_10153046364954616_1427293804678173831_n-225x300.jpg 225w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010640/10458555_10153046364954616_1427293804678173831_n.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@the_beautyinsider</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>This pic is of my friend Ros Layton who was appearing in a shoot we were doing for the Australian Women&#8217;s Weekly. I was the Beauty and Health Director there for many years. Isn&#8217;t Ros gorgeous? She&#8217;s 50. Amazing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What three beauty products won’t you leave home without?<br />\n</strong>I never go anywhere without a tube of the Aussie cult lip product <a href="http://www.lanolips.com"><strong>Lanolips</strong></a>. My favourite shade is Rhubarb but as long as I have a tube I’m easy. I also like a tinted moisturiser and a cream blush. Today you’ll find <a href="https://www.laprairie.com.au/au/face?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImfrz9Nua1QIViBiPCh3M0w9NEAAYASAAEgIAKPD_BwE">La Prairie Radiance Cellular Cream Blush, $90</a>, in my GUCCI handbag. It’s gorgeous plus has a generous mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes you an expert anyway?</strong><br />\nI’m not sure I would use those words to describe myself but I have worked as a journalist since I was 17 years old. I started off in hard news in a very tough, old-fashioned newspaper where I was trained and in the toughest of ways. If I made a mistake I paid for it in blood. It was a hard gig and I went home to my parents and cried every single weekend but I can now string a perfectly grammatical sentence together and I know damn well how to stage a decent interview and write an excellent piece.</p>\n<a href="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010902/profile-shot.tiff"><img class="size-full wp-image-2689 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22010902/profile-shot.tiff" alt="" /></a>\n<p><em>This is me with the genius beauty guru <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alphiesadsad/">Alphie Sadsad of Bobbi Brown</a>. He did my makeup before filming at Channel Nine. I think I was appearing on A Current Affair. Obviously I look amazing &#8211; because he is a god.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Have you had any serious standout moments? Met anyone amazing?</strong></p>\n<p>I have been working in this field for most of my life and I still love the pants off it! Beauty is, bottom line, fun. And yes, it is frivolous. No doubt. It’s a long way from neurosurgery … but it has the capacity to change the way people see themselves, to lift their mood and to allow themselves to feel beautiful. To me, that means everything.<br />\nMy highlights always relate to that … They revolve around seeing a very regular person being transformed, watching them leave a makeover with their shoulders straight and their chin up and their soul smiling. Who wouldn’t want to be around that ever day?</p>\n<p>And sure &#8211; I&#8217;ve met some very, very famous people but the ones that stand out the most to me are actually the regular women I meet when I&#8217;m hosting events.</p>\n<p><strong>Name your three fave beauty treatments?</strong><br />\nIt’s not a terribly exciting list but I will not go without a <strong>gel nail pedicure</strong>. I generally go with OPI because the quality is amazing and the colour range is incredible although I always choose the same shade &#8211; <a href="https://m.myer.com.au/shop/mobile/mystore/big-apple-red-132035590-132047920">Big Apple Red.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Lash extensions. Always!</strong><br />\nI try and give them up but I just never, ever can. They’re such an easy way to look pretty without making any effort at all! If I’m careful and don’t sleep on my face I can get a good two months out of them too.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2690" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2690" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011123/me-JPG-242x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011123/me-JPG-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011123/me-JPG.jpg 477w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@the_beautyinsider</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>I wear lash extensions pretty much always. It means I can get up and go to work and look alive &#8211; even when I&#8217;m basically not. I go to Amy-Jean Linnehan at <a href="http://www.amyjean.com.au">Amy-Jean Eye Couture</a>. She is so very, very good at what she does. Also, she&#8217;s hilarious. Just saying.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Botox!</strong><br />\nIf I have the money (heck, even if I don’t) this is the beauty treatment I do not skip. Just a little to soften the lines across the forehead and my crow’s feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Anything you really don&#8217;t like or do you love it all?</strong><br />\nI’m not a fan of body wraps. You know where they layer you up with something, wrap you like a burrito and then wander away and leave you for what seems like forever while you sweat and wriggle and count sheep. Those … I am not a fan of those!</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2692 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011902/womanity-jpg-229x300.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011902/womanity-jpg-229x300.jpg 229w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22011902/womanity-jpg.jpg 759w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" />\n<p><em>One super sexy scent. It&#8217;s very hard to find but I&#8217;m okay &#8230; I&#8217;ve got maybe half a dozen bottles stashed. That should last me a while. Shouldn&#8217;t it?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Favourite scent right now?</strong><br />\nMy all-time favourite fragrance is Womanity by Thierry Mugler. It’s not easy to come by and I suspect that’s because it’s not a big seller. It’s one of those scents that people either utterly adore or loathe. It makes me weak at the knees. One spritz is all I need. It makes me feel incredibly sexy, powerful and sophisticated all at the same time.</p>\n<p><b>Is being Beauty Editor as amazing as it looks? </b><br />\nThe biggest high is definitely the people involved. The women I work with are like my very irritatingly pretty sisters! We do also get to do some very luxurious things … certainly not things I could afford to do if I didn’t work in this industry.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2693" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2693" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG-300x297.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="297" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG-300x297.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/22012624/Janine-D-JPG.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@the_beautyinsider</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Like check this girl out for instance.

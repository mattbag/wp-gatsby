Like to learn more? We thought so. Ladies and gentleman &#8211; life (and also beauty, fashion and of course career) advice from the very clever clogs Pip.</p>\\n<p><strong>1. A little bit about you and your professional background please.</strong><br />\\nI am from New Zealand. I grew up in a little coastal town in Northland New Zealand. I grew up on the ocean and I spent many hours  running amok in my dad’s pharmacy. I think my interest in health and wellness was sparked as a little girl especially natural health. I am a graphic designer &amp; marketing guru by study but I love the water and one of my hobbies is underwater photography.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. And now Tonik. How did the product come to be?</strong><br />\\nIt came about after years of travelling and having to cart around bottles of apple cider vinegar in my bags. I also hated the taste of apple cider! I was on a work trip in Indonesia and the idea just dawned on me and was one of those magical moments where I thought, hang on a minute what about apple cider in capsule form? The rest is history but I am really lucky to have a father who is a pharmacist so we both worked on formulas and coming up with the Toniks.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. What do you hope to achieve with the brand &#8211; both for yourself and those who buy it?</strong><br />\\nIf I can change just one person&#8217;s health and over all wellbeing then I will be kicking goals. I have taken apple cider for the better part of 10 years and it has done wonders for my skin, hair nails and digestive systems. There is so much out there claiming X Y &amp; Z for health and wellness but the beauty about Tonik is it really is all natural and organic. My overall goal is to create a wellness hub where people can have access to unlimited information and support from like-minded individuals in the health and wellness area.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3206\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164743/Tonik_Creative_3-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>4. Can you pass on any general business advice or is it just too tricky?</strong><br />\\nI believe in following your gut instinct. I am no wonder woman but the idea was just so strong in my mind I had to do something about it. The process took just over two years to be able to launch Tonik so the only advice I would have is run the marathon not the sprint. It&#8217;s best do it right from the get go.</p>\\n<p><strong>5. Finish the sentence &#8230; a woman in business can achieve … </strong><br />\\nAbsolutely anything she believes she can. Dreams come true to those who chase them fearlessly.</p>\\n<p><strong>6. We were crazy for fitness, then leisure-wear, now cocooning and body positivity. Do you foresee any other trends?</strong><br />\\nNatural health is the next big thing, it all comes down to looking after yourself and feeling great in the skin you are in. I strongly believe natural health is the key to living a long and happy life!</p>\\n<p><strong>7. Give me three top beauty tips please &#8230;</strong><br />\\nDrinking lots of water, exercise daily &amp; taking time for yourself whenever you can</p>\\n<p><strong>8. What does you beauty routine look like &#8230;</strong><br />\\nGosh that’s embarrassing, I don’t have any routine. If I can leave the house looking half decent I&#8217;m having a good day.</p>\\n<p><strong>9. Three fashion + style tips please &#8230;</strong><br />\\nComfort first, a belted dress with boots and a big handbag.</p>\\n<p><strong>10. How about health + fitness tips? As personal (or not) as you please. </strong><br />\\nI think it&#8217;s so important to keep moving. It&#8217;s good for the head and the body. I start my day off with bootcamp and if I don’t go I regret it as it helps me wake up and get ready for everything that&#8217;s ahead.</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3205\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-300x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23164631/Coconut-Oil-Capsules-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>11. It is currently 1.21am and I should be asleep but I am working, working, working which is not good. It&#8217;s so hard to get it all done. How do you fit everything in?</strong><br />\\nI hear ya! I have had to learn a lot about balancing work / life. The best thing I ever did was disconnect my phone when I leave the office. I think switching off gives you the time to be super focused when you need to be switched on.</p>\\n<p><strong>12. Women are killer business owners because … </strong><br />\\nWe can multi-task ( haha am I allowed to say that? )</p>\\n<p><strong>13. Do you have any advice for women wanting to launch a new business or grow the one they already have? </strong><br />\\nI think you really have to value and believe in whatever it is your doing. If you don’t believe in it or swear by it why would anyone else want a bar of it? Stay focused, write goals and go into a new day with positive thoughts. Negativity will get you nowhere. I learnt that the hard way!</p>\\n<p><strong>14. Practical tips of any kind? Instagram, a good PR agent, a solid support team? </strong><br />\\nI think as you grow, the support team is the biggest help. I am so lucky I have such an amazing support team.</p>\\n<p><strong>15. Any downsides to being a woman in business? </strong><br />\\nOh definitely &#8230; it consumed me until recently. I have been extremely focused and it isolated me from family and friends. It&#8217;s all about balance. Once you nail the balance you&#8217;re sorted on all fronts!</p>\\n<p><strong>16.

Right now it&#8217;s all about growing the brand into something I can look at and be really proud of. I want to create much more than just a product business &#8211; I want to create a community.</p>\\n<p><strong>17.

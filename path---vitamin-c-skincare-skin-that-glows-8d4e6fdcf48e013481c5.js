But the sun here is powerfully harsh.</p>\n<p>The result &#8211; visible signs of premature ageing such as fine lines and wrinkles, rough patches, sagging and, ugh, sun spots.</p>\n<p>You probably guessed by the tone there that we&#8217;re none too keen on any of those. So when we heard that there&#8217;s a magical ingredient that can not only resolve those issues, but actually prevent some of them from occurring in the first place we got pretty excited.</p>\n<p>We immediately hunted down someone who would know all about it. And that someone was <a href="http://www.assurecosmeticcentre.com.au">dermal therapist Anna Robinson</a>. And she revealed the secret &#8211; drum roll please &#8211; vitamin C. We also discovered from another beauty insider, who wanted to remain nameless, that it&#8217;s this very ingredient that models use to get their impossibly luminescent glow.</p>\n<p>Want to know more? We certainly did and so we gave Anna a bit of a grilling. And this is how it went.</p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin C seems to be super popular right now yes?</strong></p>\n<p>Vitamin C has consistently been our best-selling product for at least eight years now. It works so well in conjunction with our in-clinic treatments, as it helps clients with their pre- and post-treatment skincare, and helps maintain their results after treatment.</p>\n<p>With our Australian climate being so harsh, I believe absolutely everyone should be using it to help protect their skin against harmful free radical damage.</p>\n<p>It is an essential step in any skincare routine, both male and female.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3021" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02025242/J-Obagi-C.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="331" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02025242/J-Obagi-C.jpg 292w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02025242/J-Obagi-C-265x300.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" />\n<p>Anna likes the Obagi range in particular the vitamin C products. <a href="http://www.obagi.com.au/products.html">Obagi Professional-C Serum 15%, $120.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Are there rules for when we’re using skincare ingredients with vitamin C?</strong></p>\n<p>Vitamin C is a morning-only serum, as it protects your skin against free radical damage during daylight hours. It should always be used first thing after cleansing and toning, followed by a moisturiser and a physical SPF 30+.</p>\n<p>It is also important to research your vitamin C serum before buying. For it to be effective, it needs to be in a pure, stable form, made from L-Ascorbic Acid. There are a lot of products out there claiming to contain vitamin C, however many do not have the right concentration, meaning they are not as effective or beneficial to the user.</p>\n<p><strong>If we use it and we use it as per directions, how long will it take for us to see results? Actually &#8230; what are the results?</strong></p>\n<p>Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant for the skin. It helps protect from harmful environmental stressors by neutralising free radicals on the skin before they cause damage. It also assists in cellular repair of the skin.</p>\n<p>Without vitamin C, when we go outside and the sun hits our face and chest, a chemical reaction occurs where our melanocytes turn into melanin, leaving us with unsightly pigmentation which builds up over the years. The correct use of Vitamin C serum is clinically proven to inhibit melanin production.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3022" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030040/J-Skin-C-141x300.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030040/J-Skin-C-141x300.jpg 141w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030040/J-Skin-C.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 141px) 100vw, 141px" />\n<p>There are plenty of vitamin c products available. Try <a href="http://www.skinceuticals.com.au/Antioxidants/C-E-Ferulic/p2755.aspx">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic, $214.</a></p>\n<p>A lot of people do not realise that sunscreen only stops you from burning, it won’t necessarily stop you from still tanned or developing freckles. That is where vitamin C comes in, as it blocks melanin production, while your sunscreen protects from burning. So, using vitamin C and SPF together every morning is the best possible thing you can do to prevent and protect your skin from damage.</p>\n<p>Over time, vitamin C will help fade your pigmentation, but most importantly, it helps prevent it from developing in the first place. Prevention is always best!</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3024" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030608/J-Ordinary-287x300.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030608/J-Ordinary-287x300.jpg 287w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/02030608/J-Ordinary.jpg 662w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" />\n<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.priceline.com.au/the-ordinary-vitamin-c-suspension-23-ha-spheres-2-30-ml?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1qbaxLuE1gIVmgYqCh0o4g9HEAYYAiABEgKVaPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Sphere 2%, $9.80.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Anything else this powerhouse vitamin can do?</strong></p>\n<p>The use of antioxidants on the skin can also help prevent DNA damage from electronic devices such as mobile phones and computers.</p>\n<p><strong>So there you have it.

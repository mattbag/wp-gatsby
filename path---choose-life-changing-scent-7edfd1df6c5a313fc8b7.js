Indeed, he&#8217;s something of a rock star in the world of scent &#8211; if that means anything to you.</p>\n<p>And if it doesn&#8217;t &#8211; this will. He has created celebrated fragrances for Lanvin, Jean Paul Gaultier, Narciso Rodriguez and Dior. All of these scents have been utterly unique and if you&#8217;re one of the lucky ones who has a bottle, you&#8217;ll also know they are literally life-changing.</p>\n<p>During a recent visit to Australia we sat down with Francis (yes &#8211; we really did!) and talked all things fragrance and this is what he taught us.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about the so-called signature scent?</strong></p>\n<p>I do not believe in one single signature fragrance. Women are so multifaceted nowadays and gifted. The same way they have a wardrobe for their clothing, the same way I do believe they can have a fragrance wardrobe to accompany them every day, in all their moments, from intimate ones to official ones.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the most beautiful scent?</strong></p>\n<p>The most beautiful fragrance is the one that gives you an incomparable emotion. It may be you have one, may be you have two or three or even more. What matters the most is to have the connection with this unparalleled sensory medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Fragrance should smell delightful and &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>It should make you feel beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>Should I wear a scent at work?</strong></p>\n<p>When working in an office or close quarters with others your scent should always be more quiet, subdued.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1225" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15225044/MFK-Rouge540-Bottle-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15225044/MFK-Rouge540-Bottle-214x300.jpg 214w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15225044/MFK-Rouge540-Bottle-768x1075.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15225044/MFK-Rouge540-Bottle-732x1024.jpg 732w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" />\n<p><b>Is there a scent rule I should never break?</b></p>\n<p>Never forget to put your fragrance on.</p>\n<p><strong>Scent should be applied to &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Right next to where you want to be kissed!</p>\n<p><strong>Date night means a fragrance that is …</strong></p>\n<p>Sexy to you and one in which you feel comfortable in and also beautiful.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you explain top, heart and base notes to us?</strong></p>\n<p>These words correspond to the three stages of evolution of a fragrance. At each of the stages you smell different aspects, accords and ingredients.</p>\n<p>The top notes are the first notes you smell when you have just sprayed your perfume. Then come the heart notes. After more time you smell the base notes. These define the scent. They are it&#8217;s trail.</p>\n<p><strong>Your top three fragrances please and why?</strong><br />\nMy latest release <a href="http://mecca.com.au/maison-francis-kurkdjian/baccarat-rouge-540-edp/I-023388.html">Baccarat Rouge 540</a> (because it is my latest release). And the next two ones (because there are the next ones). As a perfumer and creative person, I am always looking to what is next.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27131033/The-Hatmaker10845.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"4a601d22-d609-5b63-bb63-450411b14d51"}}}});

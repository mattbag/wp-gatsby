The ACT local and owner of the SoyBoy Candles has this look perfected. These are his tips.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Never shave your neck clean.</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Manliness doesn&#8217;t end in a perfectly sharp line and neither should your beard.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Keep the beard burly and little bit wild.</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While they shouldn&#8217;t look homeless, they shouldn&#8217;t look too manicured either. Channel more Jesus less Harry Potter Hagrid… </span><span class="s1">Regular shampoo and conditioner work a treat, but if you have a hot date, a beard wash will ensure your beard is a lot cleaner than your thought pattern…</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Moisture is key</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fact &#8211; Beards itch. The cure? Beard oil. The dreaded itch is no joke, keeping your beard hydrated with an oil will soothe the beast and also stop hair from breaking and growing in uneven.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">His Kingdom combed.</span></strong></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Give it a quick comb through.

No one wants a face like an old leather wallet. And never wash your face with soap. I know us guys can be cheap, but not that cheap. </span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A man&#8217;s hair should always be clean and kept. And never on your back….</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When choosing a fragrance always make sure it is a scent that is fresh and masculine. Avoid those sold in a litre bottle (there’s no need to baste in it). </span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There&#8217;s nothing sexier on a first date than accessorising your megawatt smile with minty fresh breath. There will be no chance of a good night kiss (or more) if your breath smells like it was hit by a semi trailer three weeks back. </span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And finally, if you&#8217;re inviting a date home make sure you always set the mood with the right lighting.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Soy Boy Signature Candle will ensure your man cave smells like they will be spending the night and the ambient glow will be flattering to all body parts when you finish that imaginary coffee that you invited them in for.</span></p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02153417/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-e1488432891529.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"beauty-talk",name:"Beauty Talk"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"c886e125-70ee-5948-a301-26f6971af264"}}}});

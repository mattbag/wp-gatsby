What do we mean when we use the word perfect? The best skin you can possibly have &#8211; that is, fresh and dewy looking, smooth, soft and even-toned.</p>\n<p>Our feeling is you can make that dream a reality if you care for your skin in the best way possible. In our minds that&#8217;s <strong>cleansing morning and night, moisturising</strong> and using an extra product here and there to target your specific issues &#8211; if you have any. But lately we&#8217;ve also been seeing a LOT of toners on the shelves of our fave beauty stores. Toner. WTF! A gimmick surely?</p>\n<p>We put this to<a href="https://helendowsleylashes.com.au"> celebrity makeup artist Helen Dowsley</a> over a glass of champagne (okay &#8211; three). And this is what she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sorry.Â But yes. <strong>You need to use toner</strong>. After you cleanse in the morning and after you cleanse at night.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Damn it.</p>\n<p>Apparently, once skin is cleansed it needs a range of ingredients to restore and repair its surface. And toner is the perfect way to provide those.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A liquid toner can instantly give skin a generous dose of these important substances in a way that a moisturiser can&#8217;t <strong>(lotion and cream moisturisers work in a different manner than liquids)</strong>,&#8221; points out Paula Begoun, beauty expert and founder of the beauty line <a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com.au">Paula&#8217;s Choice</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The right toner can give your skin a healthy dose of what it needs to look younger, fresher, and smoother, right after cleansing and throughout the day, as well as provide a bit of extra cleansing just in case you missed some areas, such as around your hairline or jaw.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Helen agrees. She insists all of her A-List clients use it and twice daily.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re often sceptical too,&#8221; she explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But when they see results they change their minds.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Toners to try</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1853" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220326/PC-JPG-144x300.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220326/PC-JPG-144x300.jpg 144w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220326/PC-JPG.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 144px) 100vw, 144px" />\n<p><a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com.au/shop/skin-care-categories/toners/_/Resist-Weightless-Advanced-Repairing-Toner">Paula&#8217;s Choice Resist Weightless Advanced Repairing Toner, $32</a>,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1854" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220935/soothing-facial-toner-16667-176x300.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220935/soothing-facial-toner-16667-176x300.jpg 176w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220935/soothing-facial-toner-16667-768x1310.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23220935/soothing-facial-toner-16667-600x1024.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.priceline.com.au/simple-soothing-facial-toner-200-ml">Simple Soothing Facial Toner. $9.99</a>.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1856" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23221501/the-oil-absorbing-tonic-35613-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23221501/the-oil-absorbing-tonic-35613-225x300.jpg 225w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/23221501/the-oil-absorbing-tonic-35613-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />\n<p><a href="http://www.cremedelamer.com.au/product/5830/26247/the-tonics/the-oil-absorbing-tonic">La Mer The Oil Absorbing Tonic, $112.</a></p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27131231/NicM_1335_RET3.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"d942eb49-fc85-5fa8-98a2-2063d1488548"}}}});

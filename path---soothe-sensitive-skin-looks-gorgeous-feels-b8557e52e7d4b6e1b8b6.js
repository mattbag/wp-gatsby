And for a good long while too.</p>\n<p>She tried everything, but Myriam couldn&#8217;t find a solution. She had her heart set on a skincare range that was gentle yet effective and equally as importantly, didn&#8217;t cost the earth.</p>\n<p>But no matter how hard she searched and how wide &#8211; Myriam could not find what she was looking for. Her dream range simply did not exist.</p>\n<p>She could have given up &#8211; learned to live with her red, tight, reactive skin, but instead, she did something kind of amazing. She created her own.</p>\n<p>That range is <a href="https://akhal.com">Akhal Beauty</a> and it&#8217;s quite something<strong> &#8211; especially for us sensitive types</strong>. Like to know more? We certainly did and so we asked Myriam to explain what sensitive skin looks like, how to know if we have it and most importantly, what to do about it.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2884" style="width: 245px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2884" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19180256/Organic_Prickly_Pear_Seed_Oil_Akhal_Beauty-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19180256/Organic_Prickly_Pear_Seed_Oil_Akhal_Beauty-245x300.jpg 245w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19180256/Organic_Prickly_Pear_Seed_Oil_Akhal_Beauty.jpg 490w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://akhal.com/collections/skincare/products/organic-prickly-pear-seed-oil">Organic prickly pear seed oil, $60</a>.

These symptoms are usually located around the nose, cheeks, and neck areas. Sensitive skin is also more susceptible to allergic reactions and broken capillaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter if your skin is sensitive?</strong></p>\n<p>Whilst redness can be masked by make-up, dry and flaking skin won’t. No matter how good your primer and foundation, on close-up the flakiness will remain visible. The only way to address effectively these symptoms is by finding out what has caused them and tackling the issue head on.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you treat it in general?</strong></p>\n<p>Most of us use many products with multiple ingredients without understanding the interactions between them. I would recommend trying to eliminate one skincare product at a time and monitor any potential improvement in your skin in the following week. If you have eliminated all your skincare products and you skin has not improved, then you must consider lifestyle factors such as your diet. Adults can develop allergies and intolerances. Whilst allergies generate an immune response, food intolerances create chemical reactions which might be more difficult for us to detect. This is something that your GP can help with by performing prick or blood tests to help you find the allergen(s).</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2881" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2881" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175732/Akhal-Beauty-Inspired-From-Moroccan-Remedies.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The natural beauty behind the Akhal brand.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Are there ingredients + treatments + steps to avoid?</strong></p>\n<p>Every individual is different but there are a few triggers which should be avoided for those with sensitive skin such as:<br />\n<strong>• Highly fragranced products</strong>: Whether it is your night cream, your soap or detergent, the ingredient behind that nice smell might be a skin irritant. It is also worth noting that under current regulations, manufacturers can include in “fragrance” ingredients other than an actual fragrance if it is defined as proprietary and they do not want to divulge that component to the market.<br />\n<strong>• Harsh or chemical-laden products:</strong> Have you stopped to think about what is in your make-up remover? To rid your skin of colouring pigments which are not supposed to fade, chances are the product you are using is packed with stripping ingredients which are irritating your skin.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2882" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2882" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175909/Essentials-Kit-Akhal-Beauty-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175909/Essentials-Kit-Akhal-Beauty-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175909/Essentials-Kit-Akhal-Beauty-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175909/Essentials-Kit-Akhal-Beauty-768x768.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19175909/Essentials-Kit-Akhal-Beauty-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t. Like harsh chemicals for example. The <a href="https://akhal.com/collections/gift-kits/products/moroccan-ritual-antioxidant-kit">Moroccan Ritual Antioxidant Kit, $89.95.</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Equally &#8211; are there any of the above we sensitive folk really should include?</strong></p>\n<p>For those with sensitive skin, “gentle does it”. I would also recommend:<br />\n<strong>• Replacing or supplementing your moisturiser with oils</strong>. They work on every level to help your skin heal and keep all its three layers moisturised not just its surface<br />\n<strong>• Harnessing the power of herbs and flowers</strong>. Whether it’s using our Rose hydrosol as a toner to calm and hydrate your skin or drinking healing herbal teas, there are so many plants that are good for your health. My favourite herbal tea includes ginger, lemongrass, calendula, hibiscus, and Moroccan rose petals. It is detoxifying, soothing and I love the taste.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, do we have to spend lots of money to keep sensitive skin in good nick?</strong></p>\n<p>There was a time where I could barely afford food let alone skincare products. That is why I wanted Akhal Beauty products to be affordable. Good organic skincare should be accessible to all! If you really are in a pinch, you could always use ingredients in your fridge. An avocado mask does wonders to your skin and ground oats work great as a gentle daily polish.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Sensitive Products We Know, Love And Recommend</strong></p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2498" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/04071419/trilogy-jpg-262x300.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/04071419/trilogy-jpg-262x300.jpg 262w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/04071419/trilogy-jpg.jpg 451w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" />\n<p><a href="https://www.trilogyproducts.com/au/products/very-gentle-hydra-mask">Trilogy Very Gentle Hydra-Mask, $37.95.</a></p>\n<a href="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19213644/Ellier-sensitive.tiff"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2934" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19213644/Ellier-sensitive.tiff" alt="" /></a>\n<p><a href="https://www.ellier.com.au/products/olive-oil-moisturiser">Ellier Olive Oil Moisturiser, $34.99.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2935" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-139x300.jpg" alt="" width="139" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-139x300.jpg 139w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-768x1652.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd-476x1024.jpg 476w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214026/Sensibio-AR-BB-Cream-40ml-2-bd.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/bioderma/bioderma-sensibio-ar-bb-cream-tube-40ml.html">Bioderma Sensibio AR BB Cream, $43.99.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2937" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-146x300.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-146x300.jpg 146w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-768x1582.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml-497x1024.jpg 497w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19214621/14_CLEANANCE_gelNett_200ml.jpg 1456w" sizes="(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px" />\n<p><a href="http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/82384/Avene-Cleanance-Cleansing-Gel-400ml">Avene Cleanance Cleansing Gel, $29.99.</a></p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2992" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22231340/Sukin-two-JPG-300x284.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="284" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22231340/Sukin-two-JPG-300x284.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22231340/Sukin-two-JPG.jpg 424w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><a href="https://sukinorganics.com/collections/sensitive-skin/products/sensitive-calming-night-cream">Sukin Sensitive Calming Night Cream, $20.95.</a></p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27131622/NicM_1381_RET.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"87da3cb5-d848-5620-a6b2-ca6e08101876"}}}});

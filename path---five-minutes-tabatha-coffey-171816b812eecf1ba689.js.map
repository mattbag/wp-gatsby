If you’ve got long hair you can chuck it up in a ponytail or put a cute braid in or throw it in a bun. When you’re a short haired girl you don’t have those options. If you’ve got short hair, the key to keeping it looking great all the time is getting it styled on time.</p>\\n<p><strong>How do I know what style will really suit me?</strong></p>\\n<p>Consulting with a professional is really helpful, however you also need to be honest.

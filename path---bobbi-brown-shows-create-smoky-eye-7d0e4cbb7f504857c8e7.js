Why? Because it&#8217;s <strong>both pretty but sexy too.</strong> And who doesn&#8217;t want to look like that?</p>\n<p>For some reason though plenty of women steer clear of the smoky eye, mainly because they believe it&#8217;s a difficult look to get right. Well, guess what &#8211; that just ain&#8217;t so.</p>\n<p><strong>Beauty guru and author Bobbi Brown</strong> says that anyone can whip up a smoky eye and quickly too.Â Here, she outlines the steps to make that smoky eye dream a reality.</p>\n<p>First, brush a white eyeshadow over the entire eyelid &#8211; up to the brow bone.</p>\n<p>Choose a medium, smoky colour for the lid itself. Apply it three quarters of the way to the brow bone.</p>\n<p>Continue to layer the colour to make it darker. Add a single layer of a darker colour on the top of the eyelid (not above) and work into the crease. Continue to apply shadow into the crease ensuring it&#8217;s dark and dramatic.</p>\n<p>Use a fingertip to blend and soften or, a blending brush.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2751 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/26004742/BB-JPG-300x238.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="238" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/26004742/BB-JPG-300x238.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/26004742/BB-JPG.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Need brushes?

Work all the way along to the inner corner of the eye.</p>\n<p>Line underneath the eye, below the lower lash line. Start at the outside corner and again, work your way in.</p>\n<p>Smudge the liner with a fingertip or a cotton bud. Then, sweep a touch of shadow over the liner with a fine liner brush.

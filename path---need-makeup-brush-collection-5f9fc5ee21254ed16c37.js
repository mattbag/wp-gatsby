Given that, we generally apply makeup with our fingers because, well, it&#8217;s quick and er, easy. But deep down we know it&#8217;s not cool to do so. At least we suspected as much, so we went to<strong> makeup artist Clint Dowdell</strong> and put it to him.</p>\n<p>Should we be applying our makeup with fingers &#8211; or, should we be just that little bit more grown-up, invest a few more minutes and use a makeup brush?</p>\n<p>&#8220;I get this question a lot. And my answer is always yes,&#8221; says Clint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Look at it this way, if you were going to paint a wall, would you use fingers or a brush?</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a huge advocate of finishing off applications with the fingers to really warm it into the skin, but to get a smooth, professional application, <strong>brushes are required.</strong>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Seems pretty clear. We need brushes. And so, we asked Clint the obvious question. Which ones?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Depends on the job,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_1869" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1869" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25212905/Essential-Collection-Brush-Set-300x270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25212905/Essential-Collection-Brush-Set-300x270.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25212905/Essential-Collection-Brush-Set-768x690.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25212905/Essential-Collection-Brush-Set-1024x920.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://nudebynature.com.au/product-category/brushes-tools/#yBacMtkVvfqFCFZw.97"><em><strong>Nude By Nature Essential Collection Brush Set, $39.95.</strong></em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For each job there are <strong>specific brushes</strong>, so a liquid foundation needs a liquid foundation brush and so on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But, if you want surefire brushes that will cover you go with this lot, says Clint.</p>\n<p><strong>A Mineral Brush (for powder foundation)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A Liquid Foundation Brush</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A Blush Brush (also for bronzer)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A Finishing Brush (to set makeup)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>An Eyeshadow Brush</strong></p>\n<p><strong>An Angled Brush (for liner)</strong></p>\n<p>From there, you can expand to your heart&#8217;s content, he says.</p>\n<p><strong>Makeup artist Casey Gore</strong> says you can get away with even fewer brushes if you choose a couple of clever multi-taskers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Makeup artists love nothing more than a brush that can do it all in terms of makeup application,&#8221; says Casey.</p>\n<p>For that she likes a <strong>Stippling Brush</strong>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It can be used very easily on both creams and powders and gives a soft-focused effect,&#8221; she adds.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_1871" style="width: 200px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1871" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25220031/TBX_StipplingBrush-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25220031/TBX_StipplingBrush-200x300.jpg 200w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25220031/TBX_StipplingBrush-768x1151.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25220031/TBX_StipplingBrush-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.thebeautyexchange.com/makeup-brushes.html"><em><strong>TBX Stippling Brush, $22.95.</strong></em></a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25192948/TBX_TheCliqueWithBrushes.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"209e1b68-207d-5e3b-b76d-d85cedac9c05"}}}});

It happens.<br />\nLife. Like we said. Tricky. Take comfort in the fact that it’s the same for all of us. And then, make a commitment to treat yourself well. You know what that means. Eat healthily. <strong>Get at least eight hours of sleep every night</strong>. Work up a sweat often and spend time with the people you love. Of course, if you want to go celebrity style, there are other options too.<br />\nOur current favourite A-List health treatment is<a href="http://duquessa.com.au/service/iv-vitamins-melbourne-and-sydney/"> IV-Vitamin Therapy</a>.<br />\nWhat’s that exactly?<br />\nPretty much what it sounds like. An IV packed full of powerful vitamins to get you back on track.<br />\nWord has it that Kim Kardashian hired a doctor to intravenously feed her a cocktail of B vitamins and anti-inflammatory medication to rejuvenate her hair and provide serious glow before attending the Met Gala. I figured if it was good enough for Kim, then it was good enough for me, so I booked in to see <strong>Katherine Millar Shannon</strong>, a Cosmetic Nurse Practitioner who has been administering IV-Vitamin Therapy at her <a href="http://duquessa.com.au">Duquessa</a> clinics for near on four years.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2274" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2274" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01002541/me-JPG-242x300.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01002541/me-JPG-242x300.jpg 242w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01002541/me-JPG.jpg 477w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Editor Kelly Baker after an IV Vitamin infusion.

When that was out of the way I relaxed with a cosy blanket and chilled. Call me crazy, but I felt deeply at ease and even rejuvenated after the 60-minute session and I continued to feel better and better as the week progressed. <strong>I also received a bunch of compliments on my glowing skin</strong>. Coincidence? I think not.<br />\nAnd according to Katherine, my results are not unusual. The vast majority of her clients report feeling energised and even experiencing glowing skin and shiny hair, not to mention a boost in mood. Nice one.<br />\n“More and more of my clients are coming in showing serious signs of fatigue &#8211; which is apparent both physically and mentally,” explains Katherine.<br />\n“Our IV Vitamin Therapy service is the treatment I’m recommending to remedy this and they have become increasingly popular for both men and women, delivering fast results and the boost which our clients desperately need.”<br />\n<strong>By using an IV nutrients are delivered direct to the blood-stream</strong>, bypassing the digestive system. The IV-Vitamin Drip offers a more instant result than ingesting vitamins via diet, with cells absorbing up to 90 per cent of the rich nutrients on offer.<br />\nTraditionally Vitamin C has been associated with fighting cold symptoms, so while it offers a kick to the immune system and a boost in energy, its benefits are as powerful on the outside as they are on the inside, says Katherine.<br />\n“The power of Vitamin C on the skin is incredible. It helps to produce collagen, boosts skin cell rejuvenation and allows the skin to repair and hydrate,&#8221; says Katherine. And what can I say &#8230; it certainly seemed to be the case for me.</p>\n<p><strong>The Duquessa Corporate IV Treatment Service is available in Sydney and Melbourne CBD and surrounds.

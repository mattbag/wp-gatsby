We read journals, hit the inter webs and even talked to our network of top makeup artists, skincare therapists and industry folk in the know. And here, is what we discovered (and then tried &#8230; because serious beauty folk do that stuff).</p>\n<p><strong>We Tried &#8230; Sugaring</strong><br />\nWaxing’s no fun, but as a regular woman not to mention a Beauty Editor, I’m no fan of hair either. Given that I was pretty excited when I heard about sugaring &#8211; a hair removal system that uses the sweet stuff instead of wax. This particular style of hair removal relies on a blend of natural ingredients including Manuka honey, aloe vera, sometimes even kiwifruit and lemon.<br />\nIt smells heavenly too.<br />\nIt leaves skin ultra smooth and soft and is significantly less painful than traditional waxing, even on the most delicate areas (yep, it’s perfect for Brazilians) and there’s no redness or irritation afterwards. For real.<br />\nFrankly, I’ll be surprised if I ever get a traditional wax again.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2433" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2433" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25205746/Kristinamendonca-JPG-bike-274x300.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25205746/Kristinamendonca-JPG-bike-274x300.jpg 274w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25205746/Kristinamendonca-JPG-bike.jpg 543w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bye bye hair!

You can pick them up at the pharmacy or supermarket for roughly the same price of a coffee and yet these handy little numbers are excellent for a variety of beauty purposes. I use them to apply Kohl liner along the upper lash line. They’re also excellent for blending and smudging shadow for a cool smoky look.<br />\nUse another to remove any shadow thats somehow ended up somewhere it shouldn’t have. Heck &#8211; it happens. Same, same for lipstick.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2440" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2440" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25211812/baby-cotton-buds-45194-209x300.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25211812/baby-cotton-buds-45194-209x300.jpg 209w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25211812/baby-cotton-buds-45194-768x1103.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25211812/baby-cotton-buds-45194-713x1024.jpg 713w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cotton buds &#8230; cute for babies, great for you too.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>We Heard About &#8230; Nontouring</strong><br />\nJust this week I heard about ‘nontouring’. That’s right &#8211; contouring &#8211; except not. Yes, it seems that Kim Kardashian’s hot trend of contouring, that is applying darker coloured products to the areas of the face you wish to recede and lighter, more shimmery products to the features you wish to highlight, is officially over. The thing to note about this is that beauty trends come and go all the time. My advice &#8211; choose those that make you feel beautiful and stick with them as long as you like. Whether Kim Kardashian is on board is neither here nor there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2431" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2431" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25184930/E-L-Blush-Brush-JPG-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25184930/E-L-Blush-Brush-JPG-300x296.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25184930/E-L-Blush-Brush-JPG.jpg 602w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Maybe just the one brush now.

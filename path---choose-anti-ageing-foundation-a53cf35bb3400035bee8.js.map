Less!</strong> Layers of heavy foundation make lines look worse.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;If you have always worn a lot of base, you probably need to use less and with a lighter touch,&#8221; says Josephine Fairley, co-author of <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Ageing-Beauty-Bible/dp/0857833170\\\">The Anti-Ageing Bible.</a></p>\\n<p>&#8220;You want uniformity &#8211; but you don&#8217;t want a mask-like effect,&#8221; she adds.</p>\\n<p>To get <strong>anti-ageing foundation</strong> just right now that you&#8217;re in your 40s try the following steps.</p>\\n<p><strong>Use a primer</strong>. Once applied let it absorb for at least five minutes.</p>\\n<p><strong>Next up foundation</strong>. Steer clear of matt finishes and also foundations that are heavy. If you have oily skin opt for an oil-free version. Dry skins will benefit from foundations that hydrate.</p>\\n<p><strong>Choose the right colour</strong>. To get the shade absolutely right test it on your neck, just below the jaw. Now look at it in daylight. If you can&#8217;t see it properly ask a trusted friend to look too. The right shade will seemingly disappear when on the skin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Apply right.</strong> Apply with a foundation brush using light strokes working outwards from the middle of the face. You don&#8217;t want to overdo it. If brushes aren&#8217;t your thing smooth with your fingers. Once the foundation is applied, press gently with the palms of your hands. This will give a lovely natural effect.</p>\\n<p><strong>Conceal if needed.</strong> Once you&#8217;re finished stand back and take a long look in the mirror. If you see any teeny, tiny flaws or redness apply a touch of concealer and voila &#8211; you&#8217;re perfect.</p>\\n<p>Some of our favourites &#8230;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3144\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205626/Estee-Lauder-JPG-189x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"189\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205626/Estee-Lauder-JPG-189x300.jpg 189w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205626/Estee-Lauder-JPG.jpg 445w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Estee Lauder Double Wear Light Stay-in-Place Makeup SPF 10, $54.</strong></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3145\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205723/Dior-Skin-JPG-109x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"109\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205723/Dior-Skin-JPG-109x300.jpg 109w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205723/Dior-Skin-JPG.jpg 210w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Dior Diorskin Nude Fluid Foundation, $89.</strong></p>\\n<img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3146\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205757/Armani-JPG-146x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"146\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205757/Armani-JPG-146x300.jpg 146w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09205757/Armani-JPG.jpg 358w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 146px) 100vw, 146px\\\" />\\n<p><strong>Giorgio Armani Designer Lift Smoothing Firming Foundation, $109.</strong></p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/09202130/Cindy-C-JPG.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"776bb317-1018-5c6f-9480-834815e936db\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---choose-anti-ageing-foundation-a53cf35bb3400035bee8.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"How To Choose The Best Anti-Ageing Foundation For You\",\"content\":\"<p>The 40 plus woman has an awful lot going for her these days.</p>\\n<p>She&#8217;s at the peak of her game in so many areas of life &#8211; and yet, she&#8217;s young enough to have so much more to look forward to. <strong>SO MUCH MORE!</strong> If you fall into that bracket you already know that of course.

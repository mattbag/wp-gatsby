You’ll also need to apply that same amount again to your neck and again to your chest if it’s going to be exposed to the sun.<br />\\nDon’t think makeup or BB creams with SPF built-in are enough.

Skip the foaming cleansers and those that double as scrubs. Both types are likely to be too harsh for mature skin. Instead, opt for cream versions or cleansing oils, which are more gentle.<br />\\nOnce skin is cleansed each morning apply a treatment serum. Use one that is specifically designed to treat any issues you have such as redness, pigmentation or signs of ageing. Allow at least five, preferably 10 minutes for your serum to fully penetrate the skin and be absorbed (otherwise you risk wiping it off during this next step). Then, apply a quality moisturiser with an SPF of 30+ or more. Opt for one that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Remember to do your neck and chest too if needed. You might like to apply cream to your hands also.<br />\\nEach evening repeat the process. However, swap your moisturiser for one that’s designed specifically for night-time use. These contain no SPF and are generally more rich.</p>\\n<figure id=\\\"attachment_2345\\\" style=\\\"width: 237px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2345\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16221024/JPG-Halle-mirror-237x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"237\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16221024/JPG-Halle-mirror-237x300.jpg 237w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16221024/JPG-Halle-mirror.jpg 473w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\\\" /><figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image: Instagram/@halleberry</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><strong>Adopt A Positive Attitude</strong><br />\\nDespite a universal shift in how we view women and ageing, many of us continue to struggle with self image.

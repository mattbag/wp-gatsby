A lot.</p>\n<p>One such high-end arrival this week &#8211; <a href="https://www.laprairie.com.au/au/illuminating-pearl-infusion/95790-01235-21.html"><strong>La Prairie White Caviar Illuminating Pearl Infusion</strong></a>. This seriously lovely product is to be applied to skin after cleansing and toning and before moisturiser. Its makers say in four weeks it will tighten and firm, brighten dullness, soften dark spots and also work to prevent future ones from ever reaching the surface.</p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t swear to all that. We&#8217;re not scientists and as such we&#8217;ve not clinically tested it. What we can say is this &#8230; It smells heavenly, it feels SUPER amazing on skin and it absorbs beautifully. Also, skin does indeed look fresh and kind of glowing. Noticeably so in fact. Also, a tiny amount covers the face and neck so the 30ml bottle will last &#8211; and last.</p>\n<p><strong>And it will need to &#8211; because it costs $660</strong>.</p>\n<p>So about that &#8230;</p>\n<p>Is it worth the spend? Well, here&#8217;s the deal. This is a truly beautiful product and it&#8217;s far superior to anything you&#8217;ll ever find in the supermarket or your local pharmacy. But, and this is a big but, there are other skincare products out there that cost less, quite a lot less, that will provide similar results.</p>\n<p>All the same, if you take La Prairie&#8217;s latest out of the bathroom cabinet each morning and it makes your heart sing AND you can afford it, we say snap it up. Because the truth is, this beautiful new product will help you to achieve your skin goals. No doubt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/29185734/LaPrairie_WhiteCaviar-Pack_PearlInfusion-c-en.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"81d15bc5-b575-550b-b6ed-c65928b84391"}}}});

My skincare regime consisted pretty much of soap, water and sunscreen and even that was on the slap dash side of things.<br />\nMy sisters and I didn’t do moisturiser as such, but massaging oil into our faces and bodies was as standard as brushing our teeth. That came to a halt when in my late teens I moved to the US and my beauty knowledge expanded exponentially. I was told oil was not cool and so I gave it up and fast.<br />\nBut in recent years oils have made an epic comeback and suddenly even the most high-end brands have one in the lineup. Might my teenage hippy habit be good for skin after all? I put this (and several other) curly questions to skincare pro <strong>Emma Hobson, Education Manager for the International Dermal Institute and Dermalogica.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Oils were out. Now they’re in. How come?</strong><br />\nThe resurgence of using plant oils has come about in two key areas of skin care, firstly with the introduction and great popularity of cleansing oils which are fantastic deep cleansing mediums. They work on the principle that like attracts like (oil attracts oil). Therefore, when you wash off the water soluble cleansing oil, you thoroughly wash away all the dirt and surface oils leaving the skin super clean. Secondly the introduction of the new super serums, many of which contain a mixture of plant oils, blended with silicones and age-fighting peptides.</p>\n<p><strong>My skin gets shiny. Won’t applying oil make that worse?</strong><br />\nLight plant-based oils absorb quickly and effectively and don’t leave an oily residue. All skin types can use an oil, but you do need to be careful about which oil you choose and how often you use it. My general rule of thumb is the more dehydrated the skin, the more frequently you can use the oil.</p>\n<p><strong>Apply oil to skin &#8230; Seriously?</strong><br />\nPlant oils have been used for centuries to help heal and protect skin. The oil works as an emollient (moisturiser). It helps to protect the barrier function and many contain protective anti-oxidants. The majority of oils for the face and body are vegetable or plant derived. These oils are generally nourishing for the skin as they’re an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Oils are good. End of. Here, our current faves.</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2598 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17142302/JPG-Origins-oil-187x300.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17142302/JPG-Origins-oil-187x300.jpg 187w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17142302/JPG-Origins-oil.jpg 568w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.mecca.com.au/origins/modern-friction-cleansing-oil-with-radiance-boosting-white-purple-rice/I-027481.html#q=cleansing%2Boil&amp;start=1">Origins Modern Friction Cleansing Oil With Radiance-Boosting White &amp; Purple Rice, $42.</a></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2584 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-232x300.jpg 232w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-768x993.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140936/DP15_0002_v2_r3-bd-792x1024.jpg 792w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />\n<p><a href="http://www.aveda.com.au/product/5211/34716/body/tension-relief/beautifying-creme-cleansing-oil/index.tmpl">Aveda Beautifying Creme Cleansing Oil, $39.</a></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2585 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16141027/CleansingOil_LM-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16141027/CleansingOil_LM-225x300.jpg 225w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16141027/CleansingOil_LM-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />\n<p><a href="http://shop.davidjones.com.au/djs/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10051&amp;productId=2132031&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;cm_mmc=googlesem-_-PLA-_-Health+and+Beauty+-+Personal+Care-_-La+Mer+The+Cleansing+Oil+200ml&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI47fnrP2M1QIVh4uPCh3Q7gtjEAQYASABEgJVWfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">La Mer The Cleansing Oil, $112.</a></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2583 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-212x300.jpg 212w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-768x1086.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140904/Hydrating-Cleansing-Oil-125ml-724x1024.jpg 724w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" />\n<p><a href="https://www.priceline.com.au/simple-kind-to-skin-hydrating-cleansing-oil-125-ml">Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil, $9.99.</a></p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2580 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-103x300.jpg" alt="" width="103" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-103x300.jpg 103w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-768x2246.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd-350x1024.jpg 350w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16140738/Palmers-Skin-Therapy-Cleansing-Oil-bd.jpg 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px" />\n<p><a href="https://www.priceline.com.au/palmer-s-ultra-gentle-facial-cleansing-oil-192-ml">Palmer’s Skin Therapy Facial Cleansing Oil, $14.99.</a></p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16143043/JPG-La-Mer-Instagram.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"c523e683-bc5e-5e1a-a9fc-557e856e57d9"}}}});

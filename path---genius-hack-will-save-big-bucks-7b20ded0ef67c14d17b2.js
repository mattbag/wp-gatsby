We&#8217;re a little, okay, a lot, obsessed with all things beauty and if truth be told, we spend far too much pursuing this passion. So, we were pretty excited when we stumbled across this genius hack via <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/makeup-skincare/news/a46429/beauty-hack-cut-products-open/">Seventeen Magazine</a>.</p>\n<p>The magazine&#8217;s beauty gurus (who are likely as obsessed as we are) stumbled across this tip on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddicts/comments/629x09/and_this_ladies_is_why_you_cut_open_your/">Reddit board Makeup Addicts.</a> Apparently, a woman posted there about how she was frustrated when she couldn&#8217;t get any more of her favourite eye cream out of the tube &#8211; despite being convinced there was plenty more inside. Instead of tossing the tube, however, she snipped off the top with a pair of scissors and what did she discover &#8211; a heck load of product just waiting to be used.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_1674" style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1674" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16171422/reddit-JPG-273x300.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16171422/reddit-JPG-273x300.jpg 273w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16171422/reddit-JPG.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Voila &#8211; The snipped open eye cream.

Our favourite &#8211; using a rolling pin to encourage that last bit of product out.</p>\n<p>Snipping the tops off is pretty darn clever though and can be used on all sorts of beauty, skincare and even hair products meaning you&#8217;re likely to get weeks (and weeks) more use out of all of them. And that&#8217;s news we like. The only downside to this is that it&#8217;s pretty tricky to keep your products fresh once post snip.</p>\n<p>Perhaps pop a little cling wrap across the opening handheld tight with an elastic band. Well worth it we reckon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16165839/Vic-Anderosn-JPG.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"4b2afcd1-190d-5c80-b2c5-257841fd74f0"}}}});

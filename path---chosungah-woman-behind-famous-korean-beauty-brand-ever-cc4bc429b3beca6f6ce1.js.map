Why do you think that is?</strong><br />\\nK-Beauty has a signature look. It&#8217;s all about the glowy complexion and healthy looking skin. I think that is probably what caught people’s attention. It’s something that makes you look beautiful without the need for a lot of makeup. I also think it’s the result of K Pop culture becoming big around the world.</p>\\n<p><strong>What does typical daily skincare look like for your average Korean woman?</strong><br />\\nA lot of it comes from Korea’s traditional and very popular sauna culture. Today in Korea, clinic skincare appointments are very popular and form part of everyday life for many women. We bring that home too. We use products every day such as masks. The sheet mask originated in Korea. Korean women have one on every night, not just occasionally.

Even if the world falls apart, these are the three products I always carry with me!</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2845 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06234340/JPG-CHo-blender-254x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"254\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06234340/JPG-CHo-blender-254x300.jpg 254w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06234340/JPG-CHo-blender.jpg 502w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/chosungah22/c-t-blender/V-025679.html\\\">Chosungah22 C&amp;T Blender, $56.</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Night-time ritual?</strong><br />\\nMoisturising is always key for me so I always use cotton pads that are completely drenched in my 16 Brand Multi-Toner that I keep in the freezer in a zip lock bag. Every night after my normal skincare routine, I take out one of the bags and place the cotton pads all around my face as a type of mask treatment for night-time. It’s very cooling and calming on your skin.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<img class=\\\"size-medium wp-image-2851 aligncenter\\\" src=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235914/JPG-Toner-140x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"140\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235914/JPG-Toner-140x300.jpg 140w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06235914/JPG-Toner.jpg 425w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\\\" />\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mecca.com.au/16-brand/multi-toner/I-027689.html?cgpath=brands-16bran#start=1\\\">16 Brand Multi Toner, $25.</a></p>\\n\",\"better_featured_image\":{\"source_url\":\"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/06233452/JPG-K-beauty.jpg\"},\"categories\":[{\"slug\":\"makeup\",\"name\":\"Makeup\"}]},\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"The Beauty Insider\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"0773e5d7-b1a4-5bf0-8c02-0d2ca6b98950\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/chosungah-woman-behind-famous-korean-beauty-brand-ever.json\n// module id = 813\n// module chunks = 281151380078948"],"sourceRoot":""}

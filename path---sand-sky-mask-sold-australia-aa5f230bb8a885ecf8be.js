This means that unfortunately we have a reputation for looking roughly 10 years older than we are. Horrifying but true. Our sun beats down like there&#8217;s no tomorrow and worse, we love nothing more than to be out in it. Anyway, you&#8217;re likely across all that. Sun damage, premature ageing, fine lines, spots blah blah blah &#8230;</p>\n<img class="size-medium wp-image-2611 aligncenter" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p>What you may not be across is that there are products out there that will give you that youthful glow and quick sticks. One of them is the<a href="https://www.sandandsky.com/products/purifying-pink-clay-mask"> pink clay mask by Sand &amp; Sky</a>. It works! Given that, it&#8217;s sold out in Australia already &#8211; yep, just 13 weeks after going on sale. Bummer.</p>\n<p>But if it makes you feel any better it sold out in just eight weeks in the UK! Still, there is a wait list and we recommend you get on it. Why? Because like we said, this stuff is ace and also, it bloody works. And if you&#8217;re on the list you&#8217;re going to get the mask sooner or later!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_2614" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2614" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18230525/Sand-Sky-JPG-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18230525/Sand-Sky-JPG-240x300.jpg 240w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18230525/Sand-Sky-JPG.jpg 476w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@sand&amp;sky</figcaption></figure>\n<p>That&#8217;s important because &#8230; It makes skin look youthful and fresh and glowing and all things good and nobody gave us a cent to say so &#8211; which is a shame cause we need to make some money and fast, but that&#8217;s another story! Get on the wait list and ASAP.</p>\n<p>The pink clay (yep Australian &#8211; extra bonus) draws out nasties and skin is left bright and uber fresh and in under 10 minutes. Seriously.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s inexpensive and it works. Do we know why? Look, not entirely but honestly, it does. What else do we need to say? Give it try and let us know how you go. We LOVE hearing from you.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned also for an interview with the creators of this ace product &#8211; a couple of awesome Aussie business chicks with a lot to say.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18230431/bikini-jpg.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"359da291-3e4e-5700-8292-2c5a37a8631a"}}}});

That said, the ‘beauty for all’ movement still has a long way to go.</p>\n<p>Jamie Kern Lima, CEO of It Cosmetics, highlighted this when she called for an end to ‘unattainable’ images in advertising.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3466" style="width: 492px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3466" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223441/JPG-Jamie-K.jpg" alt="" width="492" height="571" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223441/JPG-Jamie-K.jpg 492w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223441/JPG-Jamie-K-258x300.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@ITCosmetics</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While accepting the Achiever Award from the Cosmetic Executive Women Organisation recently, Kern Lima revealed that when she was first trying to get her now $1.2 billion business off the ground she had difficulty getting financial backing because she refused to use ultra thin, flawless models.</p>\n<p>One male investor even told her, “I’m just not sure women will want to buy makeup from someone who looks like you—you know, with your body and weight.”</p>\n<p>&#8220;The experts told me one thing, but my gut told me another,&#8221; she went on to say.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What my gut told me is, women are tired of buying from ads and commercials who don&#8217;t look like them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id="attachment_3467" style="width: 595px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3467" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223453/JPG-Alll-things.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="562" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223453/JPG-Alll-things.jpg 595w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223453/JPG-Alll-things-300x283.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: Instagram/@ITCosmetics</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kern Lima stuck to her guns &#8211; going on to build her billion dollar beauty empire. Can we pause for a moment here … BILLION dollar empire. Take that haters. Her success is something that Kern Lima is deeply proud of.<br />\nSo is the fact that she refused to back away from her own beliefs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the beauty industry we&#8217;ve bought into the notion that you have to show these unattainable images of aspiration in order to sell products,” she said recently.</p>\n<p>“The success of It Cosmetics, is proof that this isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>It’s worth thinking about. Beauty comes in all shades, colours, shapes and sizes. The campaigns that support the industry should reflect that.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/04223427/JPG-IT-Cos.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"beauty-talk",name:"Beauty Talk"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"d581a85e-c9f6-5f72-985c-e7660e119aed"}}}});

That&#8217;s public relations for those who don&#8217;t know &#8211; or perhaps care. The 36-year-old is the owner of the agency <a href="http://www.sweatybettypr.com">Sweaty Betty</a> and also <a href="http://theministryoftalent.com/">The Ministry of Talent</a> and she&#8217;s currently turning over many millions of dollars annually.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;s often photographed out on the town in haute couture that sells for the average Australian&#8217;s monthly wage. She has several <a href="http://australia.hermes.com/birkin/au">Hermes Birkin</a> hand bags &#8211; yes, the ones that cost somewhere in the vicinity of $200K.</p>\n<p>Her every move is reported by the tabloids and it may be you feel you know her. But I&#8217;m here to tell you &#8211; you don&#8217;t. Because what you see in the papers and read online is not the real deal. The real Roxy is something far more impressive, way more interesting and infinitely more clever. More importantly, more generous and more kind.</p>\n<p>See, you had her pegged wrong didn&#8217;t you? Because the thing is, kindness and generosity and a sweet nature don&#8217;t sell newspapers or get the clicks online. But if you want to get to know her, to see what&#8217;s she really like, read on. You&#8217;re in for a surprise &#8211; and something of a treat too.</p>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at how you started. How did you get into this industry?</strong></p>\n<p>My first paid job was at McDonalds where I learnt the meaning of hard work. It instilled at me at a young age the importance of showing up and doing the best job you could, no matter what it was. I later moved into fashion and then started my own business 13 years ago. I saw an opportunity for PR to be done differently, not the typical mainstream way it had been done. Since then we have continued to provide our clients with campaigns that stand out and get their brands known.</p>\n<p><strong>How or why do you think you&#8217;ve made such a success of it?</strong></p>\n<p>I hustle and hustle hard! I want to get the best results for my client every time. I think that clients see how hard I work for their brands and businesses and the results that the Sweaty Betty team can deliver.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1466" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08181913/Roxy-J-pilates-271x300.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08181913/Roxy-J-pilates-271x300.jpg 271w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08181913/Roxy-J-pilates.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" />\n<p><em>Working out is a significant part of Roxy&#8217;s life. Image: Instagram/@roxyjacenko</em></p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re a beautiful girl &#8211; any secrets aside from good genes?</strong></p>\n<p>Why thank you. No secrets per se, but since having my<a href="http://honey.nine.com.au/2016/12/01/07/29/roxy-jacenko-says-cancer-could-return"> cancer diagnosis</a> last year, I have made it a real focus to look after myself, eat well, exercise and also sleep – although I must admit, I love working so I probably don’t sleep as much as I should!</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you or is there no such thing?</strong></p>\n<p>There really isn’t – at the office we are running around meeting with clients, arranging shoots, events – the list never ends. I think any business owner can attest to that there is no typical day, however, when I can I do love being in the office with the team and working on creating great events and campaigns, and attacking the never ending inbox!</p>\n<p><strong>How on earth do you fit it all in?</strong></p>\n<p>If you think about it too much you simply don’t. I try not to get too worried in the detail of how much I have on each day, week or month, but just getting my head stuck in and getting it done. It can easily get overwhelming if I was to think about it – just do it!</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of mother are you?</strong></p>\n<p>Being a mother is such an incredible job. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what type (certainly not a Tiger Mum ha!). I try and have fun with my kids, not necessarily be their best friend as I do need to get them to eat their vegies, but we all have a good laugh and do not take anything too seriously.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1467" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids-300x192.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids-768x492.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08182146/Roxy-JP-kids.jpg 928w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><em>Nobody is more important to Roxy than her two children Pixie and Hunter. Image: Instagram/@roxyjacenko</em></p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been pretty candid about having some cosmetic tweaks. Are you willing to tell us what you&#8217;ve had done and why?</strong></p>\n<p>I like to keep you all guessing!!! I’ve probably not has as much as what people think, I have just had some to enhance my features, but I do also have a good skincare regime which does help as well.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about your looks now as opposed to before?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m really comfortable in who I am as a person, a mother, wife and daughter as well as business person. So whilst it’s great to look good, I’m fit healthy and that is probably finally showing which has made me more comfortable in my skin.</p>\n<p><strong>Anything you regret having done beauty and hair wise?</strong></p>\n<p>I do get a good laugh looking back at old photos, but at the time, take some haircuts in the 90’s – that was very on trend! Maybe I go overboard here and there with fake tan, but I’d much prefer to use fake than bake and age my body prematurely.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1468" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG-300x191.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG-768x488.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183113/Roxy-J-Insta-JPG.jpg 931w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><em>The PR queen has quite the bod. I mean hello! Image: Instagram/@roxyjacenko</em></p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel on the whole about women being so judged by how they look?</strong></p>\n<p>We can argue as much as we like about substance being more important, but whether we like it or not, we all judge on appearance. You don’t have to be a supermodel, but being well presented and taking pride in your appearance is important – I think this is true for men and women.</p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean for you when sites such as the Daily Mail run stories EVERY day about EVERY single thing you do?</strong></p>\n<p>I laugh a lot! If they are that interested in me going to the gym, having lunch with clients and running my business then good on them. But as they say, today’s paper is tomorrow’s fish and chip wrapping, so I really don’t get too caught up in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you ever expect life would look like this?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve never had a plan or expectation of what life is, if you do I think you can be disappointed if it never meets your expectations. I’m really proud of the business I’ve built at Sweaty Betty and of my family, they are my proudest achievement.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1469" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG-300x191.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG-768x490.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08183133/Roxy-J-JPG.jpg 927w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><em>Back in the gym where she gives it her all.

Life has been tough for you of late. When I think of it my heart hurts for you &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>As I’ve said, you just get on with it. I’ve been quite open that 2016 wasn’t my year. But this year has been great and I think will only get better.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a beauty tip we could all benefit from?</strong></p>\n<p>Sunscreen and fake tan – I don’t want to age prematurely, so a good SPF can go a long way and if you can’t get a real tan, then fake it! It is much better for you than baking in the sun, and always perks me up after a good spray.</p>\n<p><strong>Or perhaps a hair tip?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="https://labelm.com/au/product/334/label.m-dry-shampoo">Label M Dry Shampoo</a>! I wish I had a blow dry everyday, but alas, I can’t, so this keeps my hair going between appointments.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1474" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185630/Roxy-Hunter-jpg-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185630/Roxy-Hunter-jpg-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185630/Roxy-Hunter-jpg-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185630/Roxy-Hunter-jpg.jpg 594w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><em>Hair on point!

You were always TINY! It&#8217;s not true is it??</strong></p>\n<p>Being diagnosed with breast cancer last year made me reassess my food and fitness regime. My health became the biggest priority and the weight slipped off. I didn’t realise I had 10kg to lose, but seeing the results and feeling better, encouraged me to keep up my training and eating well.</p>\n<p><strong>Please give me a few tips on the &#8216;lift selfie&#8217;. I always look dreadful.</strong></p>\n<p>Haha! Its all in the angle, lighting and of course the outfit. I’ve never set out to perfect the lift selfie, but over time its kind of become my thing, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roxyjacenko/?hl=en">Instagram</a> is such a great platform to have fun with.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1473" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185510/Life-selfie-jpg-268x300.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185510/Life-selfie-jpg-268x300.jpg 268w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/08185510/Life-selfie-jpg.jpg 532w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" />\n<p><em>The magic of the lift selfie.

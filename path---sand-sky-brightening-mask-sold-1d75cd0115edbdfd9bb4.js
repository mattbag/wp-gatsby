They&#8217;re also the founders of the super successful beauty delivery service Bellabox. The sisters, twins actually, have something of a knack when it comes to business, the beauty business in particular.</p>\n<p>We love their <a href="https://www.sandandsky.com">Sand &amp; Sky Brightening Mask</a> and we&#8217;re big fans of <a href="https://bellabox.com.au">Bellabox </a>too. Aside from that though, we were super interested in how these two clearly clever women made both projects into the smash hits they are. So we did the sensible thing &#8211; and asked them.</p>\n<p>So here you are. The secrets of success &#8211; Hamilton sister style.</p>\n<p><strong>A little bit about yourselves both please …</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH</strong>: We’re twin sisters, mums, and the founders of bellabox and Sand &amp; Sky. I am based in Melbourne, and Emily is based out of Singapore.</p>\n<p><strong>How did this particular product come to be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> After years of studying what our members loved at bellabox, we tried to find a gap in the market and to produce a super results-orientated product that looks great on social media. Additionally, after many years living abroad we understood the attraction of Australia to our international friends – our accent embodies a relaxed beach culture, with glowing skin of course!</p>\n<p>So we wanted to bring Australia to the world and we wanted to show off the power of the ingredients produced here. We were also super keen to support Australian industry.</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> We have both lived overseas for many years and what we realised is that everywhere we went we were recognised as being Australian, and this came with the assumption that we were friendly, laid back, beachy and living the dream. Australia has become really cool internationally and we wanted to be able to bring a piece of Australia to the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>We knew people could use something that was proven to be amazing for them that was made with Aussie ingredients. We are very keen to support the Australian beauty industry and help return manufacturing here, too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3321" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01215732/Bellabox-8506.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p>Emily and Sarah Hamilton &#8211; sisters, co-workers and damn clever woman.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s so great about it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Results, results, results. Everyone is time poor so we can’t wait two weeks to see the benefits of a product. We had to make sure that you would feel a difference each and every time you used our Sand &amp; Sky Mask. No ingredients are wasted, everything is at active levels and as Australian ingredients come from a pure environment, a little bit has immediate impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think social media has had a part to play in its popularity?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Definitely, and more so because people are sharing their results in real time – everyone wants to be the first to know about a product so that they can share it with the rest of the world, quickly! Plus we really love the Australian bright vibe of the brand and packaging which looks great on social media.</p>\n<p><strong>On that, how do you feel about social media as opposed to more traditional forms of advertising and publicity?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Every medium has its benefits. We love real time feedback from customers on social media and the ability for a product to go viral very very quickly. However, there is still a big trust element to more traditional advertising and we want to reach everyone, so we don’t want to limit how we can show off Sand &amp; Sky!</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2608" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG-300x300.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG-150x150.jpg 150w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225104/Sand-and-Sky-JPG.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Our top video has gone viral with over 3.5 million views, so this illustrates the added value of social media!</p>\n<p><strong>Sisters &#8211; working together &#8230; Pros? Cons? Recommend others try it and if so any tips?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH</strong>: Haha, we are pretty honest with each other which means we can get over issues pretty quickly. Plus we have worked together before and have enormous respect for each other and we share being determined and hard working, so we can’t argue about that!</p>\n<p><strong>The beauty business is firing &#8211; what would you say to other folk who would like to get in on that action?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Social media gives everyone the ability to launch a product quickly and to harness the amazing viral impact you can reach. But to create a social media star, you need to focus on creating a product that really brings the user real and immediate results. It can&#8217;t just be good, it has to be amazing!</p>\n<p><strong>How do we keep our skin glowing and fresh (aside from this mask obviously!)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> We try really hard to properly remove makeup each night! Lots of hydration, vitamin C and vitamin A.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the best corporate I&#8217;m here to do business don&#8217;t mess with me but heck I still look damn good style of makeup?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Whatever makes you comfortable! Worry about yourself first and own your look – if others don’t like it then that is there problem. Also check your attitude and presence, become authentic and create an impact when you meet with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Same same for hair?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Ditto. It shows your personality when you dress the way you want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3329" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01223118/JPG-skin-mask-sand-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01223118/JPG-skin-mask-sand-300x215.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01223118/JPG-skin-mask-sand.jpg 711w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>And again for outfits &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> I would say, go bright. No navy suits! Stand out with colour blocking! Also, bring your energy as it will show.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you think women fit into the landscape of business?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> We were brought up without consideration of what our sex meant for our future in business, so this is always a hard one to answer. We can see the challenges for women and we are lucky to have a really empowered team that should not see being a woman as an issue. So how do women fit in? Just the same as men, with a few more hurdles that need to be faced.</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> When we left university and started our careers, we felt empowered to achieve anything we wanted! Both of us really followed our ambitions around the world, where any opportunity presented itself. I think most entrepreneurs do the same.</p>\n<p>But now targeting women on e-commerce makes sense, as more women shop and they spend more. Not only that, we are the fastest growing social ecommerce company, and we connect with our female customers each day on social media. As we intimately know and use the products we create, we can use our women power for the better!</p>\n<p><strong>Are we better? Worse? And if so in what ways?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> We are the best that we can be, no point worrying about what others are doing!</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Half the world is made up of women. If you find you are not achieving your dreams in business, there are plenty of other areas to achieve it. Chase the opportunity.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2611" src="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy-300x169.jpg 300w, http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/18225908/999-sand-and-sky-iphone-copy.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />\n<p><strong>Your future looks like?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SH:</strong> Fun and relaxed hopefully. We are starting to focus more on retail for Sand &amp; Sky after launching in Harvey Nichols in the UK.</p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> We are working on expanding the Sand &amp; Sky Australian Pink Clay range with two new products planned for 2017. We are researching new concepts to grow the reach and the product range for 2018. It’s time to put Australian botanicals on the map!</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a five-year plan?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> We have a 24-month plan; more products and another Australian botanical range. We are investing in super growth for 2018!</p>\n<p><strong>Believe in goal-setting and if so, your specific formula? Vision board? Diary?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> I really believe in self-improvement and so I set myself goals to learn something new, from a sport, to management and areas of the business. I have my own formula for this, to allocate a month and as much time as I can, which includes reading books, being coached and attending information seminars or events. I try to do this twice a year. I am planning to dive really deep into brand story telling in the coming weeks. Upping my tennis game is always on my list too!</p>\n<p><strong>Women who want to be successful must always &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Discover your true self, set goals and focus.</p>\n<p><strong>And never &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> Never give up, and try not to blame others!</p>\n<p><strong>And you will both ALWAYS tell other young women in life that &#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EH:</strong> I believe in the mantra, you are the creator of your own life. You are responsible for what happens and the direction it takes. It is empowering for me to believe that.</p>\n',better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01214008/503-sand-and-sky_adj-1.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"beauty-talk",name:"Beauty Talk"},{slug:"skincare",name:"Skincare"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"ca09fc43-a8fa-5465-b988-8f79f11b7def"}}}});

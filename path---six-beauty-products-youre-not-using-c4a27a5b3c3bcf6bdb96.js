Lotions and creams, gels and powders, brushes, lipsticks, eyeshadows and more.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, however, the items that should be in the cabinet are frequently nowhere to be found. Here, a <strong>Beauty Editor’s</strong> list of the products you never knew you needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Primer</strong></p>\n<p>Primers burst onto the scene roughly 10 years ago leaving your average woman utterly baffled. But these products are not just simple to use, they’re game changers.</p>\n<p>Think of it like this &#8230; when you paint a wall you don’t just slap on a coat on a paint. No, you prep first and then apply an undercoat (hello primer).</p>\n<p>Same goes for applying foundation. If you want it to go on easy and not settle into any fine lines or tiny flaws, then you need to first apply primer. This will give a smooth base and also, provide your foundation with something to group meaning it will last longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Brow Mascara</strong></p>\n<p>A mascara style brow brush is a must-have. Here’s a tip though. Make sure it’s in a shade that suits your natural hair colour. To get the full effect, apply at the root of the brow using a gentle back and forth motion rather than just brushing across the top.</p>\n<p>Add a clear mascara style brow product afterwards to keep hair in place if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Eyelash Curler</strong></p>\n<p>There are some very clever mascaras on the market right now. They curl, separate, add thickness and length. But nothing (and I mean NOTHING) transforms lashes like a quality curler does. Keep one handy and curl seconds before you apply your mascara. Start at the base of your lashes and squeeze the curler tight. Repeat mid lash. Then, apply your mascara for knock-out, doe-eyed sexiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Moisturiser with SPF</strong></p>\n<p>We all know that we need to wear sunscreen 365 days a year and yet, so many of us don’t. But skipping sunscreen is a huge risk. It may mean premature signs of ageing such as fine lines, sagging and worse, skin cancer. Plus, all those anti-ageing creams and treatments you invest in are effectively rendered useless if you don’t wear sunscreen.</p>\n<p>Ensure you’re covered by combining your moisturiser and sun protection in one.</p>\n<p><strong>Cheek and Lip Crayon</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve no doubt seen these thick, crayon-style lip pencils that can be used to add just a hint of colour to the lips, or layered for a more impressive pout. They’re a blend of lipstick and lip balm, meaning they feel soft and soothing on the mouth yet provide awesome colour.</p>\n<p>They can also be used on the cheeks for a natural, flush. Better still, they require zero skill and can be applied in no time at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaseline Jelly</strong></p>\n<p>It’s the jar your mum kept in the medicine cabinet way back when. She whipped it out in times of chapped lip crises or used it as a barrier cream when you skinned your knees. You likely tossed yours when you left primary school opting instead for something far more sophisticated, but Vaseline Jelly is well worth keeping at hand.</p>\n<p>This simple, inexpensive product is a genius moisturiser that’s perfect for dry, cracked hands and hard heels. It’s also the best lip balm going and, a little dab on the apples of your cheeks is an excellent highlighter.</p>\n",better_featured_image:{source_url:"http://dcqiwphk5imn5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27131219/NicM_1530_RET.jpg"},categories:[{slug:"makeup",name:"Makeup"}]},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"The Beauty Insider"}}},pathContext:{id:"b8aab2d1-a865-5809-871b-f7e4d53b465c"}}}});
